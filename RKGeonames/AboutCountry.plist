		<key>about</key>
		<string>Austria, officially the Republic of Austria, is a landlocked country in Central Europe. It borders both Germany and the Czech Republic to the north, Slovakia and Hungary to the east, Slovenia and Italy to the south, and Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the west. The capital is the city of Vienna on the Danube River.  The origins of Austria date back to the ninth century, when the territory later known as Upper and Lower Austria became increasingly populated.

Austria is a parliamentary representative democracy comprising nine federal states and is one of six European countries that have declared permanent neutrality and one of the few countries that includes the concept of everlasting neutrality in its constitution. Austria has been a member of the United Nations since 1955 and joined the European Union in 1995.</string>
		<key>climate</key>
		<string>The greater part of Austria lies in the cool/temperate climate zone in which humid westerly winds predominate. With over half of the country dominated by the Alps, the alpine climate is the predominant one. In the East, in the Pannonian Plain and along the Danube valley, the climate shows continental features with less rain than the alpine areas. Although Austria is cold in the winter, in the summer temperatures can be relatively warm reaching 20-35 degrees Celsius. Austria has a humid continental climate.  Austria is well aware of the effect of climate change and global warming and they have joined their European neighbors in initiating studies and research to combat climate change and global warming.</string>
		<key>energy</key>
		<string>In 1972, the country began construction of a nuclear-powered electricity-generation station at Zwentendorf on the River Danube, following a unanimous vote in parliament. However, in 1978, a referendum voted approximately 50.5% against nuclear power, 49.5% for and parliament subsequently unanimously passed a law forbidding the use of nuclear power to generate electricity.  Austria currently produces more than half of its electricity by hydropower. Together with other renewable energy sources such as wind, solar and biomass powerplants, the electricity supply from renewable energy amounts to nearly 80% of total use in Austria with the rest being produced by gas and oil powerplants.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Austria is one of the 10 richest countries in the world in terms of GDP per capita, has a well-developed social market economy, and a high standard of living. Until the 1980s, many of Austria&apos;s largest industry firms were nationalised; in recent years, however, privatisation has reduced state holdings to a level comparable to other European economies. Labour movements are particularly strong in Austria and have large influence on labour politics. Next to a highly-developed industry, international tourism is the most important part of the national economy.

Germany has historically been the main trading partner of Austria, making it vulnerable to rapid changes in the German economy. However, since Austria became a member state of the European Union it has gained closer ties to other European Union economies, reducing its economic dependence on Germany. In addition, membership in the EU has drawn an influx of foreign investors attracted by Austria&apos;s access to the single European market and proximity to the aspiring economies of the European Union.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>Austria looks to keep expanding its economy, while continuing to produce other forms of renewable energy, such as wind, solar, nuclear etc... Austria has been able to remain neutral in most negative foreign affairs, and will look to continue to do so.  Austria will look to strengthen their renewable resource industry and make themsleves a competitive producer in the European marketplace, not only for their own benefit, but for the benefit of the world.</string>

		<string>The People&apos;s Democratic Republic of Algeria is in North Africa, and the largest country on the Mediterranean Sea. It borders Tunisia, Libya, Niger, Mali and Mauritania, Morocco and the Sahara. Algeria is a member of the Arab League, UN, African Union and OPEC.</string>
		<key>languages</key>
		<string>Arabic is the official language of Algeria, with many of the population speaking Algerian Arabic and Hassaniya. The dialect Tamazight is also spoken by a considerable percentage of the country&apos;s population. French is widely spoken across the country as a second language, and taught in most schools. </string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Algeria&apos;s economy is almost entirely dependant upon the production of fossil fuels, and in particular natural gas, of which it has generous reserves. The government has put sustained effort into attracting foreign investment for the country. Industry and agriculture are important economic sectors for Algeria, employing the biggest percentage of the workforce. Agricultural produce includes wheat, barley, oats, grapes, olives, citrus, fruits; sheep and cattle. Apart from petrol and natural gas, Algeria&apos;s main industries are light industries, mining, electrical, petrochemical and food processing. Algeria&apos;s major trading partners are France, Italy, China, Germany, Spain, US and Turkey.</string>
		<key>energy</key>
		<string>Because of Algeria&apos;s dependence on fossil fuels for its main source of income, it is unsurprising that natural gas and petroleum produce most of the country&apos;s energy. In the future, however, Algeria will have to look for more long-term and sustainable methods of producing fuel, for example from the renewable hydro and solar power.</string>
		<key>culture</key>
		<string>Algeria attracts tourists to the country through its several UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including Tipasa, Al Qal&apos;a of Beni Hammad and the mountain range Tassili n&apos;Ajjer.</string>

		<key>culture</key>
		<string>Since 1788, the primary basis of Australian culture has been Anglo-Celtic, although distinctive Australian features soon arose from the country&apos;s natural environment and Indigenous cultures. Since the middle of the 20th century, Australian culture has been influenced by American popular culture (particularly television and cinema), by Australia&apos;s Asian neighbours, and by large-scale immigration from non-English-speaking countries.</string>
		<key>about</key>
		<string>Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country in the southern hemisphere comprising the mainland of the world&apos;s smallest continent, the major island of Tasmania, and numerous other islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.  Neighbouring countries include Indonesia, East Timor, and Papua New Guinea to the north, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and New Caledonia to the north-east, and New Zealand to the south-east.

For around 40,000 years before European settlement commenced in the late 18th century, the Australian mainland and Tasmania were inhabited by around 250 individual nations of indigenous Australians.  After sporadic visits by fishermen from the immediate north, and European discovery by Dutch explorers in 1606, the eastern half of Australia was claimed by the British in 1770 and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales, founded on 26 January 1788. The population grew steadily in the following years,the continent was explored, and during the 19th century another five largely self-governing Crown Colonies were established.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>The Australian economy will look to continue to grow, this will be partly based on its wealth of natural resources and tourism industry, as well as its strength as a commodity exporter.  Also Australia will continue to be a leader in global warming and climate change research and analysis, as they know far too well how dangerous these changes could be to their wealth of natural resources and beauty.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>The Australian dollar is the currency of the Commonwealth of Australia, including Christmas Island, Cocos Islands, and Norfolk Island, as well as the independent Pacific Island states of Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu. The Australian Securities Exchange and the Sydney Futures Exchange are the largest stock exchanges in Australia.  Australia is one of the most laissez-faire capitalist economies, according to indices of economic freedom. Australia&apos;s per capita GDP is slightly higher than that of the UK, Germany, and France in terms of purchasing power parity. The country was ranked third in the United Nations 2007 Human Development Index, first in Legatum&apos;s 2008 Prosperity Index, and sixth in The Economist worldwide Quality-of-Life Index for 2005. All of Australia&apos;s major cities fare well in global comparative liveability surveys, Melbourne reached 2nd place on The Economist&apos;s 2008 World&apos;s Most Livable Cities list, followed by Perth at 4th, Adelaide at 7th, and Sydney at 9th.  Australia has a booming tourism industry as well as a strong exporting industry based upon exporting commodities rather then manufactored goods.</string>
		<key>climate</key>
		<string>Although most of Australia is semi-arid or desert, it includes a diverse range of habitats from alpine heaths to tropical rainforests, and is recognised as a megadiverse country. Because of the continent&apos;s great age, its extremely variable weather patterns, and its long-term geographic isolation, much of Australia&apos;s biota is unique and diverse.  Australia has the greatest number of reptiles of any country, with 755 species. The federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 is a legal framework for the protection of threatened species. Numerous protected areas have been created under the national Biodiversity Action Plan to protect and preserve unique ecosystems; 64 wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention, and 16 World Heritage Sites have been established. Australia was ranked 13th in the world on the 2005 Environmental Sustainability Index.
Because of the threats of global warming and climate change to Australia&apos;s treasured natural wealth, they can taken the initiative to conduct research and studies on climate change and global warming in an attempt to better understand and control the situation.</string>

		<string>The official language of Argentina is Spanish, usually called castellano by Argentines.  Studies have shown that the sland spoken in some parts of Argentia is closer to the Italian Neopolitan dialect than any other language, this can be attributed to the large number of Italians in the country.  Italian immigration and other European immigrations influenced Lunfardo, the slang spoken in the Río de la Plata region, permeating the vernacular vocabulary of other regions as well.  According to one survey, there are around 1.5 million Italian speakers (which makes it the second most spoken language in the country).  Standard German is spoken by between 400,000 and 500,000 Argentines of German ancestry, though it has also been stated that the there could be as many as 1.8 million, German is the third or fourth most spoken language in Argentina.</string>
		<key>about</key>
		<string>Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic, is a country in South America, constituted as a federation of 23 provinces and an autonomous city. It is the second largest country in South America and eighth in the world by land area and the largest among Spanish-speaking nations, though Mexico, Colombia and Spain are more populous.  Argentina borders Paraguay and Bolivia to the north, Brazil and Uruguay to the northeast, and Chile to the west and south.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>The Argentine economy is expected to grow in the coming years, mainly due to their natural resource wealth and strong productive workforce.  Furthermore, Argentina has taken the initiative into climate change studies and research. This, added with their economic expansions and reform policy will make them a dominant force in the global economy in the years to come.</string>
		<key>climate</key>
		<string>Argentina is one of the world&apos;s major agricultural producers, ranking third worldwide in production of honey, soybeans and sunflower seeds and is ranked as fifth in the production of maize and eleventh in wheat. In 2007, agricultural output accounted for 9.4% of GDP and nearly one third of all exports. Soy and its byproducts, mainly animal feed and vegetable oils, are major export commodities at 24% of the total. Wheat, maize, sorghum and other cereals totaled 8%. Cattle-raising is also a major industry, though mostly for domestic consumption.  Argentica relies heavily on their wealth of natural resources and understand the severity of the climate change issue.  Argentina has ratified the Kyoto Protocol as of 2001 and has recently begun research into the areas of coastal flooding and ocean water temperature change.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Argentina has abundant natural resources, a well-educated population, an export-oriented agricultural sector and a relatively diversified industrial base.  In 2003 expansionary policies and commodity exports triggered a rebound in GDP. This trend has been largely maintained, creating millions of jobs and encouraging internal consumption. The socio-economic situation has been steadily improving and the economy grew around 9% annually for five consecutive years between 2003 and 2007 and 7% in 2008.</string>

		<string>Angola, officially the Republic of Angola is a country in south-central Africa bordered by Namibia on the south, Democratic Republic of the Congo on the north, and Zambia on the east; its west coast is on the Atlantic Ocean.  Angola was a Portuguese overseas territory from the 16th century to 1975. The country is the second-largest petroleum and diamond producer in sub-Saharan Africa. According to the International Monetary Fund, more than $4 billion in oil receipts have disappeared from Angola&apos;s treasury in the 2000s.</string>
		<key>culture</key>
		<string>Portugal ruled over Angola for 400 years and both countries share cultural aspects: language (Portuguese) and main religion (Roman Catholic Christianity). The Angolan culture is mostly native Bantu which was mixed with Portuguese culture. In the Moxico province more than 10,000 persons are Spanish-speaking due to the presence of Cuban troops during the civil war.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Angola&apos;s economy has undergone a period of transformation in recent years, moving from the disarray caused by a quarter century of war to being the second fastest growing economy in Africa and one of the fastest in the world. In 2004, China&apos;s Eximbank approved a $2 billion line of credit to Angola. The loan is being used to rebuild Angola&apos;s infrastructure, and has also limited the influence of the International Monetary Fund in the country.  Growth is almost entirely driven by rising oil production which surpassed 1.4 million barrels per day in late-2005 and which is expected to grow to 2 million barrels per day by 2007. Control of the oil industry is consolidated in Sonangol Group, a conglomerate which is owned by the Angolan government. In December 2006, Angola was admitted as a member of OPEC.  The economy grew 18% in 2005, 26% in 2006 and 17.6% in 2007 and it&apos;s expected to stay above 10% for the rest of the decade. The security brought about by the 2002 peace settlement has led to the resettlement of 4 million displaced persons, thus resulting in large-scale increases in agriculture production.</string>
		<key>languages</key>
		<string>Portuguese is spoken as a first language by 60% of the population, and as a second language by another 20%. The majority dominance of Portuguese over the native Mbundu and other African languages is due to a strong influence from Portugal and Brazil, as opposed to in Mozambique, which being more remote from the Lusosphere, retained a majority of Bantu language speakers.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>Angola will seek to expand in the future, they are already one of the largest diamond producers in the world and they will continue to grow off of this aspect.  Even with all of there current difficulties that they are facing, they are still one of the fasting growing economies in the world and they will continue to do so in the future.

		<key>about</key>
		<string>Albania was ruled by the Byzantine Empire from the 6th to the 12th century. Prior to this it had been part of Illyria and then the Roman Empire. In the 15th century an alliance of Albanian chiefs tried and failed to prevent invasion by the Ottoman Turks, resulting in Albania being under Turkish rule until it finally gained independence in 1912.

Albania is one of the poorest countries in Europe, and has had a turbulent past. One of the main battlefields during World War I, it became a republic following the war; a landlord, Ahmed Zogu, proclaimed himself king and president. Following the annexing of Albania to Italy in 1939, King Zog&apos;s rule ended and in 1944, Communist guerrillas and Hoxha seized the country. A Stalinist, Hoxha ruled the country under  strict, oppressive Communist ideals, executing those who did not sympathise with him.

After disputes between the Russian Communists and Hoxha, he adopted Chinese Communism, but after the death of Mao in 1978, Albania began to adopt its own socialist systems and ideas.

The Communist Party of Labour renamed itself the Socialist Party and renounced all of its former ideals; however, following election in 1991, the cabinet was soon forced to resign following widespread street protests. The Democratic party came into power with a former cardiologist at its helm, Sali Berisha, the first elected President. Democracy was established in Albania for a few short years.

However, in 1997, the temporary democracy was destroyed. Many Albanians invested in suspect pyramid schemes. When five of these collapsed, Albanians lost an estimated $1.2billion in savings. They turned their anger on the government, which is believed to have sanctioned these pyramid schemes. There was widespread gangster and rebel-lead crime, and the frail infrastructure which had been established fell apart.

Albania was involved heavily in sheltering Albanians driven from their homes in Kosovo, and was an outpost for NATO troops.

Even now disputes between political parties in Albania are retarding the efforts to improve the levels of crime in the country, to start to reinstate the infrastructure that was lost in 1997, and to begin to develop the country&apos;s economic and social status.

		<string>Albania is a member of the UN, OSCE, Council of Europe, NATO, WTO, as well as being a potential member state of the EU. The country has a transitional economy, as it moves from centrally-run (from its Soviet days) to market economy, and recently free-market reforms have meant that the country has been opened up to foreign investment </string>
		<key>culture</key>
		<string>Food: The main meal for Albanians is lunch, which is normally accompanied by a salad. Traditional dishes include aubergine appetisers, dolma (grape leaves stuffed with rice), Albanian potato salad, bean jahni soup, baked fish, baked lamb and yoghurt, fried meatballs, korce kolloface and much more. Albanian deserts are similar to those found throughout the Balkans.; Sport: Football is extremely popular in Albania, but basketball, volleyball and gymnastics are also widespread.; Music: There are three main types of folk music in Albania: northern Ghegs, and southern Labs and Tosks. The northern music is said to be rugged and heroic, whilst the southern is described as beautiful and gentle. The music is used to orally convey traditional stories, and often uses rhythms such as 3/8, or 5/8.In the 1930s, urban art songs in the north combined the traditional northern folk style with Turkish modes. Marie Kraja, as one of Albania&apos;s first popular singers, sung in this genre.;Art - Throughout its Communist history, the predominant depiction in Albanian art is of the proletariat. However, in more recent years modern artists have been finding new methods by which to express the struggle of the Albanians.

		<string>The United Arab Emirates is a federation of seven states situated in the southeast of the Arabian Peninsula in Southwest Asia on the Persian Gulf, bordering Oman and Saudi Arabia. The seven states, termed emirates, are Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras al-Khaimah, Sharjah and Umm al-Quwain.  The UAE, rich in oil and natural gas, has become highly prosperous after gaining foreign direct investment funding in the 1970s. The country has a relatively high Human Development Index for the Asian continent, ranking 31st globally and had a GDP purchasing power parity of $200.5 billion in 2009 according to the IMF.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>The United Arab Emirates has a rapidly growing economy with a high GDP per capita and energy consumption per capita.  The GDP per capita is currently the 14th in the world and 3rd in the Middle East after Qatar and Kuwait as measured by the CIA World Factbook, or the 17th in the world as measured by the International Monetary Fund.  Most all available statistics indicate that the UAE currently has one of the fastest growing economies in the world. According to a recent report by the Ministry of Finance and Industry, real GDP rose by 35% in 2006 to $175 billion, compared with $130 billion in 2005. These figures would suggest that the UAE had the fastest growing real GDP in the world, between 2005 and 2006.</string>
		<key>education</key>
		<string>The education system through secondary level is monitored by the Ministry of Education. It consists of primary schools, middle schools and high schools. The public schools are government-funded and the curriculum is created to match the United Arab Emirates development&apos;s goals and values. The medium of instruction in the public school is Arabic with emphasis on English as a second language. There are also many private schools which are internationally accredited. Public schools in the country are free for citizens of the UAE, while the fees for private schools vary.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>The United Arab Emirates will continue to grow and expand based off their booming economy, because of their oil wealth and exports as well as their man made palace city of Dubai.  Dubai has become one of the most popular tourist attractions in the world, and contains the world&apos;s tallest man made structure, the Burj Dubai.  Along with Dubai, the rest of the country will look to expand its tourism industry to even higher levels in the future.</string>
		<key>transportation</key>
		<string>Dubai has a public transport agency called the Dubai Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA). This authority is responsible for the bus network currently in operation. Recently, the RTA purchased 300 buses from Germany&apos;s MAN AG in an effort to reduce the city&apos;s growing traffic problem. RTA is also developing the Dubai Metro system. The first line (Red Line) is expected to be completed by September 2009. The yellow lines, currently in development, will go through the man-made Palm Islands.  Lately, the Emirate of Dubai created a new electronic toll collection system in July 2007, which emphasizes the system’s congestion management objectives as well as the choice of technology for the toll system. The new system, which is called Salik utilizes the latest technology to achieve free flow operation with no toll booths, no toll collectors, and no impact to traffic flow, allowing vehicles to move freely through the toll point at highway speeds. Each time one passes through a Salik toll point, the toll of AED 4 (1.09 USD) is deducted from his or her prepaid toll account using advanced Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. The new system was implemented by the Roads and Transport Authority of Dubai. </string>

		<string>Afghanistan is a member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).  The nation&apos;s economy began to improve since 2002 due to the infusion of multi-billion US dollars in international assistance and investments, as well as remittances from expats.  It is also due to dramatic improvements in agricultural production and the end of a four-year drought in most of the country.</string>
		<key>outllook</key>
		<string>Afghanistan will look to continue and expand its nation&apos;s infrastructure as well as to expand on its telecommunications industry as well.  There is much room to grow and expand within their economy and they look to continue to do so in the near future, cementing their identity as an important link between Europe, Asia and the Middle East.</string>
		<key>communications</key>
		<string>Telecommunication services in the country are provided by Afghan Wireless, Etisalat, Roshan, Areeba and Afghan Telecom. In 2006, the Afghan Ministry of Communications signed a US$64.5 million agreement with ZTE Corporation for the establishment of a countrywide fibre optic cable network. This will improve telephone, internet, television and radio broadcast services throughout the country.  Television and radio broadcastings are available in most parts of the country, with local and international channels or stations.
The nation&apos;s post service is also operating. Package delivery services such as FedEx, DHL and others are also available.</string>
		<key>media</key>
		<string>The media was tightly controlled under the Taliban and other periods in its history, and was relatively free in others. Under the Taliban, television was shut down in 1996, and print media were forbidden to publish commentary, photos or readers letters.  The only radio station broadcast religious programmes and propaganda, and aired no music.  After the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001, press restrictions were gradually relaxed and private media diversified. Freedom of expression and the press is promoted in the 2004 constitution and censorship is banned, though defaming individuals or producing material contrary to the principles of Islam is prohibited.  Over 400 publications are now registered and 60 radio stations, a major source of information, currently exist.  Foreign radio stations, such as the BBC World Service, also broadcast into the country.</string>

		<string>Chile, officially the Republic of Chile is a country in South America occupying a long and narrow coastal strip wedged between the Andes mountains and the Pacific Ocean. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage at the country&apos;s southernmost tip. It is one of only two countries in South America that does not have a border with Brazil. The Pacific forms the country&apos;s entire western border, with a coastline that stretches over 6,435 kilometres.  Chilean territory extends to the Pacific Ocean which includes the overseas territories of Juan Fernández Islands, the Salas y Gómez islands, the Desventuradas Islands and Easter Island located in Polynesia. Chile also claims 1,250,000 square kilometres (480,000 sq mi) of territory in Antarctica.

Chile&apos;s unusual, ribbon-like shape has given it a hugely varied climate, ranging from the world&apos;s driest desert — the Atacama — in the north, through a Mediterranean climate in the centre, to a snow-prone Alpine climate in the south, with glaciers, fjords and lakes.  The northern Chilean desert contains great mineral wealth, principally copper. The relatively small central area dominates the country in terms of population and agricultural resources. This area also is the cultural and political center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century, when it incorporated its northern and southern regions. Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands and features a string of volcanoes and lakes. The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords, inlets, canals, twisting peninsulas, and islands. The Andes Mountains are located on the eastern border.  Chile feels the effects of global warming and climate change perhaps more than any other country as it has such a diverse climate and extreme temperate regions, going from dry desrt, to arctic tundra.</string>
		<key>environment</key>
		<string>A long and narrow coastal Southern Cone country on the west side of the Andes Mountains, Chile stretches over 4,630 kilometres (2,880 mi) north to south, but only 430 kilometres (265 mi) at its widest point east to west. This encompasses a remarkable variety of landscapes. It contains 756,950 square kilometres (292,260 sq mi) of land area.
The northern Atacama Desert contains great mineral wealth, primarily copper and nitrates. The relatively small Central Valley, which includes Santiago, dominates the country in terms of population and agricultural resources. This area also is the historical center from which Chile expanded in the late nineteenth century, when it integrated the northern and southern regions. Southern Chile is rich in forests, grazing lands, and features a string of volcanoes and lakes. The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords, inlets, canals, twisting peninsulas, and islands. The Andes Mountains are located on the eastern border. Chile is the longest north-south country in the world, and also claims 1,250,000 km2 (480,000 sq mi) of Antarctica as part of its territory.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>The year of 2006 was a record year for Chilean trade. Total trade registered a 31% increase over 2005. During 2006, exports of goods and services totaled US$58 billion, an increase of 41%. This figure was somewhat distorted by the skyrocketing price of copper. In 2006, copper exports reached a historical high of US$33.3 billion. Imports totaled US$35 billion, an increase of 17% compared to the previous year. Chile thus recorded a positive trade balance of US$23 billion in 2006.  The main destinations for Chilean exports were the Americas (US$39 billion), Asia (US$27.8 billion) and Europe (US$22.2 billion). Seen as shares of Chile&apos;s export markets, 42% of exports went to the Americas, 30% to Asia and 24% to Europe. Within Chile&apos;s diversified network of trade relationships, its most important partner remained the United States. Total trade with the U.S. was US$14.8 billion in 2006. Since the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement went into effect on January 1, 2004, U.S.-Chilean trade has increased by 154%. Internal Government of Chile figures show that even when factoring out inflation and the recent high price of copper, bilateral trade between the U.S. and Chile has grown over 60% since then.</string>
		<key>tourism</key>
		<string>Tourism in Chile has experienced sustained growth over the last few decades. In 2005, tourism grew by 13.6%, generating more than 4.5 billion dollars of which 1.5 billion is attributed to foreign tourists. According to the National Service of Tourism,  2 million people a year visit the country. Most of these visitors come from other countries in the American continent, mainly Argentina; followed by a growing number from the United States, Europe, and Brazil with a growing number of Asians from South Korea and PR China.</string>
		<key>finance</key>
		<string>Chile&apos;s financial sector has grown quickly in recent years, with a banking reform law approved in 1997 that broadened the scope of permissible foreign activity for Chilean banks. The Chilean Government implemented a further liberalization of capital markets in 2001, and there is further pending legislation proposing further liberalization. Over the last ten years, Chileans have enjoyed the introduction of new financial tools such as home equity loans, currency futures and options, factoring, leasing, and debit cards. The introduction of these new products has also been accompanied by an increased use of traditional instruments such as loans and credit cards.  Chile maintains one of the best credit ratings in Latin America.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>Chile looks to continue to grow based off of its divers climate and abundance of natural resources.  It has been a global leader in copper production and exportation and will continue to do so.  Also the close relations that Chile has with the United States has allowed both countries to prsoper economically over the past few years and Chile will look to continue this trend in the future, in order to further maintain and stimulate their economic growth.</string>

		<key>about</key>
		<string>Azerbaijan or the Republic of Azerbaijan is the largest and most populous country in the South Caucasus, located partially in Eastern Europe and partially in Western Asia. It is bounded by the Caspian Sea to the east, Iran to the south, Armenia to the west, Georgia to the northwest, and Russia to the north.  The country is one of the founder members of GUAM and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and joined the Commonwealth of Independent States in September 1993, the are also a member of Nato and the United Nations</string>
		<key>development</key>
		<string>Once Azerbaijan gained their independence, they became a member of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Islamic Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank.  The banking system of Azerbaijan consists of the National Bank of Azerbaijan, commercial banks and non-banking credit organizations.  The National Bank serves as Azerbaijan&apos;s central bank, empowered to issue the national currency, the Azerbaijani Manat, and to supervise all commercial banks. Two major commercial banks are the state-owned International Bank of Azerbaijan and the United Universal Joint-Stock Bank.</string>
		<key>resources</key>
		<string>Azerbaijan is rich in natural gas and oil, as well as other resources such as gold, silver, iron, copper, titanium, chromium, manganese, cobalt, molybdenum, complex ore and antimony.  As Western oil companies are able to tap deepwater oilfields untouched by the Soviet exploitation, Azerbaijan is considered one of the most important spots in the world for oil exploration and development. Meanwhile the State Oil Fund was established as an extra-budgetary fund to ensure the macroeconomic stability, transparency in the management of oil revenue, and the safeguarding of resources for future generations.</string>
		<key>climate</key>
		<string>Due to the various climates and weather conditions in Azerbaijan, they are particularly affected by the rising global temperatures and climate change.  This not only effects their economy in terms of agricultural production and tourism, but their health and safety as well.  This has prompted the government of Azerbaijan to begin research and studies on global warming and climate change, in order to better understand and hopefully control the effects of climate change and global warming.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>In the future, Azerbaijan looks to continue to expand their economy, especially in the field of agriculture and industry.  Also Azerbaijan has begun to invest in their tourism industry, mostly through foreign investment, but through government sponsored programs as well.  Azerbaijan has become a leader in the Middle East for global warming and climate change research and looks to continue this trend in the future.</string>

		<string>Arabic is the official language of Bahrain. However, elsewhere, English is very widely used. Some Bahraini people speak a dialect of the Persian language.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Oil was found in Bahrain in 1932, and this led to extremely fast modernisation, and an economic boom, with Bahrain becoming the fastest growing economy in the Arab world, and the freest economy in the Middle East. The production and processing of petroleum accounts for 60% of exports, and 30% of GDP in Bahrain. The country has highly advanced communication and transport facilities and houses two multinational firms. Its GDP is $14.11 billion and its major trading partners include Saudi Arabia, US, Germany, Japan, UK and France. Aside from oil, other key industries include offshore banking, fertilisers, ship repairing, tourism, and natural resources include gas, fish and pearls.
The Qatar-Bahrain Friendship Bridge is to be built linking Bahrain to Qatar to the south-east, with construction starting in 2009.</string>
		<key>energy</key>
		<string>Since the discovery of oil in 1932, Bahrain has formed links with other countries in order to exploit the natural resources - petroleum is their biggest export as well as industry, providing almost all of the country&apos;s energy.</string>
		<key>tourism</key>
		<string>Bahrain has become a popular tourist destination, with more than 8 million visitors a year. Though mostly made up of people coming from neighbouring Arab countries, there are increasing numbers of people visiting from further afield due to the Bahrain Grand Prix, and also because of the country&apos;s Arab heritage and history, and also its reputation as being liberal and modern. The country has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Its National Museum has exhibits from the first human settlers on the island, from over 9000 years ago.</string>
