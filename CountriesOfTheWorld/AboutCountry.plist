		<string>Antigua and Barbuda is a twin-island country lying between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. It consists of two major inhabited islands, Antigua and Barbuda, and a number of smaller islands (including Great Bird, Green, Guinea, Long, Maiden and York Islands and further south, the island of Redonda). The permanent population numbers about 81,800 (at the 2011 Census) and the capital and largest port and city is St. John&apos;s, on Antigua.
Separated by a few nautical miles, Antigua and Barbuda are in the middle of the Leeward Islands, part of the Lesser Antilles, roughly at 17°N of the equator. The country is nicknamed &quot;Land of 365 Beaches&quot; due to the many beaches surrounding the islands. Its governance, language, and culture have all been strongly influenced by the British Empire, of which the country was formerly a part.</string>

		<string>Austria, officially the Republic of Austria, is a landlocked country in Central Europe. It borders both Germany and the Czech Republic to the north, Slovakia and Hungary to the east, Slovenia and Italy to the south, and Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the west. The capital is the city of Vienna on the Danube River.  The origins of Austria date back to the ninth century, when the territory later known as Upper and Lower Austria became increasingly populated.

Austria is a parliamentary representative democracy comprising nine federal states and is one of six European countries that have declared permanent neutrality and one of the few countries that includes the concept of everlasting neutrality in its constitution. Austria has been a member of the United Nations since 1955 and joined the European Union in 1995.</string>
		<key>climate</key>
		<string>The greater part of Austria lies in the cool/temperate climate zone in which humid westerly winds predominate. With over half of the country dominated by the Alps, the alpine climate is the predominant one. In the East, in the Pannonian Plain and along the Danube valley, the climate shows continental features with less rain than the alpine areas. Although Austria is cold in the winter, in the summer temperatures can be relatively warm reaching 20-35 degrees Celsius. Austria has a humid continental climate.  Austria is well aware of the effect of climate change and global warming and they have joined their European neighbors in initiating studies and research to combat climate change and global warming.</string>
		<key>energy</key>
		<string>In 1972, the country began construction of a nuclear-powered electricity-generation station at Zwentendorf on the River Danube, following a unanimous vote in parliament. However, in 1978, a referendum voted approximately 50.5% against nuclear power, 49.5% for and parliament subsequently unanimously passed a law forbidding the use of nuclear power to generate electricity.  Austria currently produces more than half of its electricity by hydropower. Together with other renewable energy sources such as wind, solar and biomass powerplants, the electricity supply from renewable energy amounts to nearly 80% of total use in Austria with the rest being produced by gas and oil powerplants.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Austria is one of the 10 richest countries in the world in terms of GDP per capita, has a well-developed social market economy, and a high standard of living. Until the 1980s, many of Austria&apos;s largest industry firms were nationalised; in recent years, however, privatisation has reduced state holdings to a level comparable to other European economies. Labour movements are particularly strong in Austria and have large influence on labour politics. Next to a highly-developed industry, international tourism is the most important part of the national economy.

Germany has historically been the main trading partner of Austria, making it vulnerable to rapid changes in the German economy. However, since Austria became a member state of the European Union it has gained closer ties to other European Union economies, reducing its economic dependence on Germany. In addition, membership in the EU has drawn an influx of foreign investors attracted by Austria&apos;s access to the single European market and proximity to the aspiring economies of the European Union.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>Austria looks to keep expanding its economy, while continuing to produce other forms of renewable energy, such as wind, solar, nuclear etc... Austria has been able to remain neutral in most negative foreign affairs, and will look to continue to do so.  Austria will look to strengthen their renewable resource industry and make themsleves a competitive producer in the European marketplace, not only for their own benefit, but for the benefit of the world.</string>

		<string>Aruba is an island in the southern Caribbean Sea, located about 1,600 kilometres (990 mi) west of the Lesser Antilles and 29 kilometres (18 mi) north of the coast of Venezuela. It measures 32 kilometres (20 mi) long from its northwestern to its southeastern end and 10 kilometres (6 mi) across at its widest point. Together with Bonaire and Curaçao, Aruba forms a group referred to as the ABC islands. Collectively, Aruba and the other Dutch islands in the Caribbean are often called the Netherlands Antilles or the Dutch Caribbean.
Aruba is one of the four constituent countries that form the Kingdom of the Netherlands, along with the Netherlands, Curaçao and Sint Maarten. The citizens of these countries all share a single nationality: Dutch. Aruba has no administrative subdivisions, but, for census purposes, is divided into eight regions. Its capital is Oranjestad.
Unlike much of the Caribbean region, Aruba has a dry climate and an arid, cactus-strewn landscape. This climate has helped tourism as visitors to the island can reliably expect warm, sunny weather. It has a land area of 179 km2 (69.1 sq mi) and is densely populated, with a total of 102,484 inhabitants at the 2010 Census. It lies outside Hurricane Alley.</string>

		<string>The Åland Islands or Åland is an autonomous, demilitarised, monolingually Swedish-speaking region of Finland that consists of an archipelago lying at the entrance to the Gulf of Bothnia in the Baltic Sea. Collectively, the islands in the archipelago form the smallest region of Finland, constituting 0.49% of its land area and 0.50% of its population.
Åland comprises Fasta Åland (&quot;Main Island&quot;, on which 90% of the population resides) and a further 6,500 skerries and islands to its east. Fasta Åland is separated from the coast of Sweden by 38 kilometres (24 mi) of open water to the west. In the east, the Åland archipelago is contiguous with the Finnish Archipelago Sea. Åland&apos;s only land border is located on the uninhabited skerry of Märket, which it shares with Sweden.
Åland&apos;s autonomous status means that those provincial powers normally exercised by representatives of the central Finnish government are largely exercised by its own government.</string>

American Samoa consists of five main islands and two coral atolls. The largest and most populous island is Tutuila, with the Manuʻa Islands, Rose Atoll, and Swains Island also included in the territory. American Samoa is part of the Samoan Islands chain, located west of the Cook Islands, north of Tonga, and some 300 miles (500 km) south of Tokelau. To the west are the islands of the Wallis and Futuna group.
The 2010 census showed a total population of 55,519 people.The total land area is 199 square kilometers (76.8 sq mi), slightly more than Washington, D.C. American Samoa is the southernmost territory of the U.S. and one of two U.S. territories (with Jarvis Island) south of the Equator. Tuna and tuna products are the main exports, and the main trading partner is the United States.
During the 1918 flu pandemic, the 12th governor of American Samoa John Martin Poyer quarantined the territory to stop the spread of the pandemic entering American Samoa. Because of his actions, no deaths occurred making American Samoa one of the few places in the world with this distinction.
American Samoa is noted for having the highest rate of military enlistment of any US state or territory. As of September 9, 2014, the local US Army Recruiting Station in Pago Pago is ranked #1 in production out of the 885 Army recruiting stations and centers under the United States Army Recruiting Command (USAREC), which includes all regions representing the 50 US states, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Korea, Japan, and Europe.
Most American Samoans are bilingual and can fluently speak English and Samoan or Gagana Fa&apos;asāmoa. This is the same language spoken in independent Samoa.

		<string>Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country in the southern hemisphere comprising the mainland of the world&apos;s smallest continent, the major island of Tasmania, and numerous other islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.  Neighbouring countries include Indonesia, East Timor, and Papua New Guinea to the north, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and New Caledonia to the north-east, and New Zealand to the south-east.

For around 40,000 years before European settlement commenced in the late 18th century, the Australian mainland and Tasmania were inhabited by around 250 individual nations of indigenous Australians.  After sporadic visits by fishermen from the immediate north, and European discovery by Dutch explorers in 1606, the eastern half of Australia was claimed by the British in 1770 and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales, founded on 26 January 1788. The population grew steadily in the following years,the continent was explored, and during the 19th century another five largely self-governing Crown Colonies were established.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>The Australian economy will look to continue to grow, this will be partly based on its wealth of natural resources and tourism industry, as well as its strength as a commodity exporter.  Also Australia will continue to be a leader in global warming and climate change research and analysis, as they know far too well how dangerous these changes could be to their wealth of natural resources and beauty.</string>

		<string>The Australian dollar is the currency of the Commonwealth of Australia, including Christmas Island, Cocos Islands, and Norfolk Island, as well as the independent Pacific Island states of Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu. The Australian Securities Exchange and the Sydney Futures Exchange are the largest stock exchanges in Australia.  Australia is one of the most laissez-faire capitalist economies, according to indices of economic freedom. Australia&apos;s per capita GDP is slightly higher than that of the UK, Germany, and France in terms of purchasing power parity. The country was ranked third in the United Nations 2007 Human Development Index, first in Legatum&apos;s 2008 Prosperity Index, and sixth in The Economist worldwide Quality-of-Life Index for 2005. All of Australia&apos;s major cities fare well in global comparative liveability surveys, Melbourne reached 2nd place on The Economist&apos;s 2008 World&apos;s Most Livable Cities list, followed by Perth at 4th, Adelaide at 7th, and Sydney at 9th.  Australia has a booming tourism industry as well as a strong exporting industry based upon exporting commodities rather then manufactored goods.</string>
		<key>climate</key>
		<string>Although most of Australia is semi-arid or desert, it includes a diverse range of habitats from alpine heaths to tropical rainforests, and is recognised as a megadiverse country. Because of the continent&apos;s great age, its extremely variable weather patterns, and its long-term geographic isolation, much of Australia&apos;s biota is unique and diverse.  Australia has the greatest number of reptiles of any country, with 755 species. The federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 is a legal framework for the protection of threatened species. Numerous protected areas have been created under the national Biodiversity Action Plan to protect and preserve unique ecosystems; 64 wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention, and 16 World Heritage Sites have been established. Australia was ranked 13th in the world on the 2005 Environmental Sustainability Index.
Because of the threats of global warming and climate change to Australia&apos;s treasured natural wealth, they can taken the initiative to conduct research and studies on climate change and global warming in an attempt to better understand and control the situation.</string>

		<string>The official language of Argentina is Spanish, usually called castellano by Argentines.  Studies have shown that the sland spoken in some parts of Argentia is closer to the Italian Neopolitan dialect than any other language, this can be attributed to the large number of Italians in the country.  Italian immigration and other European immigrations influenced Lunfardo, the slang spoken in the Río de la Plata region, permeating the vernacular vocabulary of other regions as well.  According to one survey, there are around 1.5 million Italian speakers (which makes it the second most spoken language in the country).  Standard German is spoken by between 400,000 and 500,000 Argentines of German ancestry, though it has also been stated that the there could be as many as 1.8 million, German is the third or fourth most spoken language in Argentina.</string>

		<string>Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic, is a country in South America, constituted as a federation of 23 provinces and an autonomous city. It is the second largest country in South America and eighth in the world by land area and the largest among Spanish-speaking nations, though Mexico, Colombia and Spain are more populous.  Argentina borders Paraguay and Bolivia to the north, Brazil and Uruguay to the northeast, and Chile to the west and south.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>The Argentine economy is expected to grow in the coming years, mainly due to their natural resource wealth and strong productive workforce.  Furthermore, Argentina has taken the initiative into climate change studies and research. This, added with their economic expansions and reform policy will make them a dominant force in the global economy in the years to come.</string>
		<key>climate</key>
		<string>Argentina is one of the world&apos;s major agricultural producers, ranking third worldwide in production of honey, soybeans and sunflower seeds and is ranked as fifth in the production of maize and eleventh in wheat. In 2007, agricultural output accounted for 9.4% of GDP and nearly one third of all exports. Soy and its byproducts, mainly animal feed and vegetable oils, are major export commodities at 24% of the total. Wheat, maize, sorghum and other cereals totaled 8%. Cattle-raising is also a major industry, though mostly for domestic consumption.  Argentica relies heavily on their wealth of natural resources and understand the severity of the climate change issue.  Argentina has ratified the Kyoto Protocol as of 2001 and has recently begun research into the areas of coastal flooding and ocean water temperature change.</string>

Angola was a Portuguese overseas territory from the 16th century to 1975. The country is the second-largest petroleum and diamond producer in sub-Saharan Africa. According to the International Monetary Fund, more than $4 billion in oil receipts have disappeared from Angola&apos;s treasury in the 2000s.</string>
		<key>culture</key>
		<string>Portugal ruled over Angola for 400 years and both countries share cultural aspects: language (Portuguese) and main religion (Roman Catholic Christianity). The Angolan culture is mostly native Bantu which was mixed with Portuguese culture. In the Moxico province more than 10,000 persons are Spanish-speaking due to the presence of Cuban troops during the civil war.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Angola&apos;s economy has undergone a period of transformation in recent years, moving from the disarray caused by a quarter century of war to being the second fastest growing economy in Africa and one of the fastest in the world. In 2004, China&apos;s Eximbank approved a $2 billion line of credit to Angola. The loan is being used to rebuild Angola&apos;s infrastructure, and has also limited the influence of the International Monetary Fund in the country.  Growth is almost entirely driven by rising oil production which surpassed 1.4 million barrels per day in late-2005 and which is expected to grow to 2 million barrels per day by 2007. Control of the oil industry is consolidated in Sonangol Group, a conglomerate which is owned by the Angolan government. In December 2006, Angola was admitted as a member of OPEC.  The economy grew 18% in 2005, 26% in 2006 and 17.6% in 2007 and it&apos;s expected to stay above 10% for the rest of the decade. The security brought about by the 2002 peace settlement has led to the resettlement of 4 million displaced persons, thus resulting in large-scale increases in agriculture production.</string>
		<key>languages</key>
		<string>Portuguese is spoken as a first language by 60% of the population, and as a second language by another 20%. The majority dominance of Portuguese over the native Mbundu and other African languages is due to a strong influence from Portugal and Brazil, as opposed to in Mozambique, which being more remote from the Lusosphere, retained a majority of Bantu language speakers.</string>

		<string>Angola will seek to expand in the future, they are already one of the largest diamond producers in the world and they will continue to grow off of this aspect.  Even with all of there current difficulties that they are facing, they are still one of the fasting growing economies in the world and they will continue to do so in the future.

Located in the north of Western Asia,it is bordered by Turkey to the west, Georgia to the north, the de facto independent Nagorno-Karabakh Republic and Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan to the south.
Armenia is a unitary, multi-party, democratic nation-state with an ancient cultural heritage. The Satrapy of Armenia was established in the 6th century BC, after the fall of Urartu. In the first century BC the Kingdom of Armeniareached its height under Tigranes the Great. Armenia became the first state in the world to adopt Christianity as its official religion,in between late 3rd to early years of the 4th century (the official date is 301 AD),becoming the first Christian nation.&quot;An Armenian principality and later a kingdom, known as Cilician Armenia, existed on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea between the 11th and 14th centuries.
Between the 16th and early 19th century, the traditional Armenian homeland composed of Eastern Armenia and Western Armenia came under rule of the rivaling Ottoman and Persian Empires, passing between the two over the centuries. By the mid 19th century, Eastern Armenia had been conquered by Russia, while most of the western parts of the traditional Armenian homeland still remained under Ottoman rule. During World War I, the Armenians living in their ancestral lands in the Ottoman Empire were systematically exterminated in the Armenian Genocide. After almost 600 years of statelessness, Armenia achieved Independence in 1918; however, theFirst Republic of Armenia, surrounded by hostile countries, was Sovietized in 1920. Between 1922 and 1991, Armenia was part of the Soviet Union. The modern Republic of Armenia became independent in 1991.
The Republic of Armenia recognizes the Armenian Apostolic Church, the world&apos;s oldest national church, as the country&apos;s primary religious establishment.Armenians have their own unique alphabet, which was invented by Mesrop Mashtots in 405 AD.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Armenia is a member of the UN, the Council of Europe, WTO, Commonwealth of Independent States, as well as NATO&apos;s Partnership of Peace. It is an emerging democracy and is geographically situated to bridge Russian and Western influence. With a GDP of approximately $26 billion, the country&apos;s workforce is mostly divided between agriculture and service industries, producing chemicals, metals, machinery and processed food. It has small deposits of gold as a natural resource, and as well as other metals, and its main exports include diamonds, food and energy. Its main trading partners are Russia, Ukraine, Belgium, Italy, Germany, Iran, Israel, US and Georgia. Like other former Soviet countries, Armenia suffered the switch from centrally governed economy to market economy, and after its introduction, the currency of the dram underwent hyperinflation. Government reforms led to a stabilising of the economy, followed by a steady growth, and new sectors including tourism, jewellery making, information and communication technology are beginning to be developed.</string>
		<key>energy</key>
		<string>Much of Armenia&apos;s energy is imported from Russia, for example gas and nuclear fuel. However, the country&apos;s main domestic fuel source is the renewable form of hydroelectric power.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>Armenian is an Indo-European language spoken by the population of Armenia. It is also spoken in the communities within the Armenian diaspora, and uses its own script, the Armenian alphabet. There is a distinction between Eastern and Western dialects and these two categories can themselves be split into subdialects - none of which have clear distinguishing borders. Other distinct dialects include the Homshetsi dialect, and Lomavren language of the Bosha, which are categorised as belonging to the Armenian family.</string>

		<string>Albania was ruled by the Byzantine Empire from the 6th to the 12th century. Prior to this it had been part of Illyria and then the Roman Empire. In the 15th century an alliance of Albanian chiefs tried and failed to prevent invasion by the Ottoman Turks, resulting in Albania being under Turkish rule until it finally gained independence in 1912.

Albania is one of the poorest countries in Europe, and has had a turbulent past. One of the main battlefields during World War I, it became a republic following the war; a landlord, Ahmed Zogu, proclaimed himself king and president. Following the annexing of Albania to Italy in 1939, King Zog&apos;s rule ended and in 1944, Communist guerrillas and Hoxha seized the country. A Stalinist, Hoxha ruled the country under  strict, oppressive Communist ideals, executing those who did not sympathise with him.

After disputes between the Russian Communists and Hoxha, he adopted Chinese Communism, but after the death of Mao in 1978, Albania began to adopt its own socialist systems and ideas.

The Communist Party of Labour renamed itself the Socialist Party and renounced all of its former ideals; however, following election in 1991, the cabinet was soon forced to resign following widespread street protests. The Democratic party came into power with a former cardiologist at its helm, Sali Berisha, the first elected President. Democracy was established in Albania for a few short years.

However, in 1997, the temporary democracy was destroyed. Many Albanians invested in suspect pyramid schemes. When five of these collapsed, Albanians lost an estimated $1.2billion in savings. They turned their anger on the government, which is believed to have sanctioned these pyramid schemes. There was widespread gangster and rebel-lead crime, and the frail infrastructure which had been established fell apart.

Albania was involved heavily in sheltering Albanians driven from their homes in Kosovo, and was an outpost for NATO troops.

Even now disputes between political parties in Albania are retarding the efforts to improve the levels of crime in the country, to start to reinstate the infrastructure that was lost in 1997, and to begin to develop the country&apos;s economic and social status.

		<string>The United Arab Emirates is a federation of seven states situated in the southeast of the Arabian Peninsula in Southwest Asia on the Persian Gulf, bordering Oman and Saudi Arabia. The seven states, termed emirates, are Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras al-Khaimah, Sharjah and Umm al-Quwain.  The UAE, rich in oil and natural gas, has become highly prosperous after gaining foreign direct investment funding in the 1970s. The country has a relatively high Human Development Index for the Asian continent, ranking 31st globally and had a GDP purchasing power parity of $200.5 billion in 2009 according to the IMF.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>The United Arab Emirates has a rapidly growing economy with a high GDP per capita and energy consumption per capita.  The GDP per capita is currently the 14th in the world and 3rd in the Middle East after Qatar and Kuwait as measured by the CIA World Factbook, or the 17th in the world as measured by the International Monetary Fund.  Most all available statistics indicate that the UAE currently has one of the fastest growing economies in the world. According to a recent report by the Ministry of Finance and Industry, real GDP rose by 35% in 2006 to $175 billion, compared with $130 billion in 2005. These figures would suggest that the UAE had the fastest growing real GDP in the world, between 2005 and 2006.</string>
		<key>education</key>
		<string>The education system through secondary level is monitored by the Ministry of Education. It consists of primary schools, middle schools and high schools. The public schools are government-funded and the curriculum is created to match the United Arab Emirates development&apos;s goals and values. The medium of instruction in the public school is Arabic with emphasis on English as a second language. There are also many private schools which are internationally accredited. Public schools in the country are free for citizens of the UAE, while the fees for private schools vary.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>The United Arab Emirates will continue to grow and expand based off their booming economy, because of their oil wealth and exports as well as their man made palace city of Dubai.  Dubai has become one of the most popular tourist attractions in the world, and contains the world&apos;s tallest man made structure, the Burj Dubai.  Along with Dubai, the rest of the country will look to expand its tourism industry to even higher levels in the future.</string>
		<key>transportation</key>
		<string>Dubai has a public transport agency called the Dubai Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA). This authority is responsible for the bus network currently in operation. Recently, the RTA purchased 300 buses from Germany&apos;s MAN AG in an effort to reduce the city&apos;s growing traffic problem. RTA is also developing the Dubai Metro system. The first line (Red Line) is expected to be completed by September 2009. The yellow lines, currently in development, will go through the man-made Palm Islands.  Lately, the Emirate of Dubai created a new electronic toll collection system in July 2007, which emphasizes the system’s congestion management objectives as well as the choice of technology for the toll system. The new system, which is called Salik utilizes the latest technology to achieve free flow operation with no toll booths, no toll collectors, and no impact to traffic flow, allowing vehicles to move freely through the toll point at highway speeds. Each time one passes through a Salik toll point, the toll of AED 4 (1.09 USD) is deducted from his or her prepaid toll account using advanced Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. The new system was implemented by the Roads and Transport Authority of Dubai. </string>

		<string>Afghanistan is a member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).  The nation&apos;s economy began to improve since 2002 due to the infusion of multi-billion US dollars in international assistance and investments, as well as remittances from expats.  It is also due to dramatic improvements in agricultural production and the end of a four-year drought in most of the country.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>Afghanistan will look to continue and expand its nation&apos;s infrastructure as well as to expand on its telecommunications industry as well.  There is much room to grow and expand within their economy and they look to continue to do so in the near future, cementing their identity as an important link between Europe, Asia and the Middle East.</string>
		<key>communications</key>
		<string>Telecommunication services in the country are provided by Afghan Wireless, Etisalat, Roshan, Areeba and Afghan Telecom. In 2006, the Afghan Ministry of Communications signed a US$64.5 million agreement with ZTE Corporation for the establishment of a countrywide fibre optic cable network. This will improve telephone, internet, television and radio broadcast services throughout the country.  Television and radio broadcastings are available in most parts of the country, with local and international channels or stations.
The nation&apos;s post service is also operating. Package delivery services such as FedEx, DHL and others are also available.</string>
		<key>media</key>
		<string>The media was tightly controlled under the Taliban and other periods in its history, and was relatively free in others. Under the Taliban, television was shut down in 1996, and print media were forbidden to publish commentary, photos or readers letters.  The only radio station broadcast religious programmes and propaganda, and aired no music.  After the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001, press restrictions were gradually relaxed and private media diversified. Freedom of expression and the press is promoted in the 2004 constitution and censorship is banned, though defaming individuals or producing material contrary to the principles of Islam is prohibited.  Over 400 publications are now registered and 60 radio stations, a major source of information, currently exist.  Foreign radio stations, such as the BBC World Service, also broadcast into the country.</string>

		<string>Chile, officially the Republic of Chile is a country in South America occupying a long and narrow coastal strip wedged between the Andes mountains and the Pacific Ocean. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage at the country&apos;s southernmost tip. It is one of only two countries in South America that does not have a border with Brazil. The Pacific forms the country&apos;s entire western border, with a coastline that stretches over 6,435 kilometres.  Chilean territory extends to the Pacific Ocean which includes the overseas territories of Juan Fernández Islands, the Salas y Gómez islands, the Desventuradas Islands and Easter Island located in Polynesia. Chile also claims 1,250,000 square kilometres (480,000 sq mi) of territory in Antarctica.

Chile&apos;s unusual, ribbon-like shape has given it a hugely varied climate, ranging from the world&apos;s driest desert — the Atacama — in the north, through a Mediterranean climate in the centre, to a snow-prone Alpine climate in the south, with glaciers, fjords and lakes.  The northern Chilean desert contains great mineral wealth, principally copper. The relatively small central area dominates the country in terms of population and agricultural resources. This area also is the cultural and political center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century, when it incorporated its northern and southern regions. Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands and features a string of volcanoes and lakes. The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords, inlets, canals, twisting peninsulas, and islands. The Andes Mountains are located on the eastern border.  Chile feels the effects of global warming and climate change perhaps more than any other country as it has such a diverse climate and extreme temperate regions, going from dry desrt, to arctic tundra.</string>
		<key>environment</key>
		<string>A long and narrow coastal Southern Cone country on the west side of the Andes Mountains, Chile stretches over 4,630 kilometres (2,880 mi) north to south, but only 430 kilometres (265 mi) at its widest point east to west. This encompasses a remarkable variety of landscapes. It contains 756,950 square kilometres (292,260 sq mi) of land area.
The northern Atacama Desert contains great mineral wealth, primarily copper and nitrates. The relatively small Central Valley, which includes Santiago, dominates the country in terms of population and agricultural resources. This area also is the historical center from which Chile expanded in the late nineteenth century, when it integrated the northern and southern regions. Southern Chile is rich in forests, grazing lands, and features a string of volcanoes and lakes. The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords, inlets, canals, twisting peninsulas, and islands. The Andes Mountains are located on the eastern border. Chile is the longest north-south country in the world, and also claims 1,250,000 km2 (480,000 sq mi) of Antarctica as part of its territory.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>The year of 2006 was a record year for Chilean trade. Total trade registered a 31% increase over 2005. During 2006, exports of goods and services totaled US$58 billion, an increase of 41%. This figure was somewhat distorted by the skyrocketing price of copper. In 2006, copper exports reached a historical high of US$33.3 billion. Imports totaled US$35 billion, an increase of 17% compared to the previous year. Chile thus recorded a positive trade balance of US$23 billion in 2006.  The main destinations for Chilean exports were the Americas (US$39 billion), Asia (US$27.8 billion) and Europe (US$22.2 billion). Seen as shares of Chile&apos;s export markets, 42% of exports went to the Americas, 30% to Asia and 24% to Europe. Within Chile&apos;s diversified network of trade relationships, its most important partner remained the United States. Total trade with the U.S. was US$14.8 billion in 2006. Since the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement went into effect on January 1, 2004, U.S.-Chilean trade has increased by 154%. Internal Government of Chile figures show that even when factoring out inflation and the recent high price of copper, bilateral trade between the U.S. and Chile has grown over 60% since then.</string>
		<key>tourism</key>
		<string>Tourism in Chile has experienced sustained growth over the last few decades. In 2005, tourism grew by 13.6%, generating more than 4.5 billion dollars of which 1.5 billion is attributed to foreign tourists. According to the National Service of Tourism,  2 million people a year visit the country. Most of these visitors come from other countries in the American continent, mainly Argentina; followed by a growing number from the United States, Europe, and Brazil with a growing number of Asians from South Korea and PR China.</string>
		<key>finance</key>
		<string>Chile&apos;s financial sector has grown quickly in recent years, with a banking reform law approved in 1997 that broadened the scope of permissible foreign activity for Chilean banks. The Chilean Government implemented a further liberalization of capital markets in 2001, and there is further pending legislation proposing further liberalization. Over the last ten years, Chileans have enjoyed the introduction of new financial tools such as home equity loans, currency futures and options, factoring, leasing, and debit cards. The introduction of these new products has also been accompanied by an increased use of traditional instruments such as loans and credit cards.  Chile maintains one of the best credit ratings in Latin America.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>Chile looks to continue to grow based off of its divers climate and abundance of natural resources.  It has been a global leader in copper production and exportation and will continue to do so.  Also the close relations that Chile has with the United States has allowed both countries to prsoper economically over the past few years and Chile will look to continue this trend in the future, in order to further maintain and stimulate their economic growth.</string>

		<string>Once Azerbaijan gained their independence, they became a member of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Islamic Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank.  The banking system of Azerbaijan consists of the National Bank of Azerbaijan, commercial banks and non-banking credit organizations.  The National Bank serves as Azerbaijan&apos;s central bank, empowered to issue the national currency, the Azerbaijani Manat, and to supervise all commercial banks. Two major commercial banks are the state-owned International Bank of Azerbaijan and the United Universal Joint-Stock Bank.</string>
		<key>resources</key>
		<string>Azerbaijan is rich in natural gas and oil, as well as other resources such as gold, silver, iron, copper, titanium, chromium, manganese, cobalt, molybdenum, complex ore and antimony.  As Western oil companies are able to tap deepwater oilfields untouched by the Soviet exploitation, Azerbaijan is considered one of the most important spots in the world for oil exploration and development. Meanwhile the State Oil Fund was established as an extra-budgetary fund to ensure the macroeconomic stability, transparency in the management of oil revenue, and the safeguarding of resources for future generations.</string>

		<string>Bahrain is the site of the ancient land of the Dilmun civilisation. Bahrain was one of the earliest areas to convert to Islam in 628 AD. Following a period of Arab rule, Bahrain was occupied by the Portuguese in 1521, who in turn were expelled in 1602 by Shah Abbas I of the Safavid dynasty under the Persian Empire. In 1783, the Bani Utbah clan captured Bahrain from Nasr Al-Madhkur and has since been ruled by the Al Khalifa royal family, with Ahmed al Fateh as Bahrain&apos;s first hakim. In the late 1800s, following successive treaties with the British, Bahrain became a protectorate of the United Kingdom. In 1971, Bahrain declared independence. Formerly a state, Bahrain was declared a Kingdom in 2002. Since early 2011, the country has experienced sustained protests and unrest inspired by the regional Arab Spring, particularly by the majority Shia population.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>Arabic is the official language of Bahrain. However, elsewhere, English is very widely used. Some Bahraini people speak a dialect of the Persian language.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Oil was found in Bahrain in 1932, and this led to extremely fast modernisation, and an economic boom, with Bahrain becoming the fastest growing economy in the Arab world, and the freest economy in the Middle East. The production and processing of petroleum accounts for 60% of exports, and 30% of GDP in Bahrain. The country has highly advanced communication and transport facilities and houses two multinational firms. Its GDP is $14.11 billion and its major trading partners include Saudi Arabia, US, Germany, Japan, UK and France. Aside from oil, other key industries include offshore banking, fertilisers, ship repairing, tourism, and natural resources include gas, fish and pearls.
The Qatar-Bahrain Friendship Bridge is to be built linking Bahrain to Qatar to the south-east, with construction starting in 2009.</string>
		<key>energy</key>
		<string>Since the discovery of oil in 1932, Bahrain has formed links with other countries in order to exploit the natural resources - petroleum is their biggest export as well as industry, providing almost all of the country&apos;s energy.</string>
		<key>tourism</key>
		<string>Bahrain has become a popular tourist destination, with more than 8 million visitors a year. Though mostly made up of people coming from neighbouring Arab countries, there are increasing numbers of people visiting from further afield due to the Bahrain Grand Prix, and also because of the country&apos;s Arab heritage and history, and also its reputation as being liberal and modern. The country has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Its National Museum has exhibits from the first human settlers on the island, from over 9000 years ago.</string>

		<string>Bangladesh, officially the People&apos;s Republic of Bangladesh, is a country in South Asia; and is bordered by India to its west, north and east; Burma to its southeast and separated from Nepal and Bhutan by the Chicken’s Neck corridor. To its south, it faces the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh is the world&apos;s eighth-most populous country, with over 160 million people, and among the most densely populated countries. It forms part of the ethno-linguistic region of Bengal, along with the neighbouring Indian states ofWest Bengal and Tripura.
The present-day borders of Bangladesh took shape during the Partition of Bengal and British India in 1947, when the region came to be known as East Pakistan, as a part of the newly formed state of Pakistan. It was separated from West Pakistan by 1,400 km of Indian territory. Due to political exclusion, ethnic and linguistic discrimination and economic neglect by the politically dominant western wing, nationalism, popular agitation andcivil disobedience led to the Bangladesh Liberation War and independence in 1971. After independence, the new state endured poverty, famine, political turmoil and military coups. The restoration of democracy in 1991has been followed by relative calm and economic progress. In 2014, the Bangladeshi general election was boycotted by major opposition parties, resulting in a parliament and government dominated by the Awami Leagueand its smaller coalition partners.
</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>Bengali is an Indo-Aryan language, derived in part from Sanskrit. It is spoken by those people living in Bengal, which is comprised of Bangladesh and West Bengal - and with around 230 million speakers, it is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, as well as the second most spoken language in India. There are several dialects of Begali, which have been clustered into four groups by a linguist - Rarh, Banga, Kamarupa and Varendra.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Bangladesh remains a developing nation, with its per capita income well below the world average - despite domestic and international support. Its GDP is $301.4 billion, and the majority of the labour-force works in the agricultural sector. The fibre jute used to be the economic mainstay of Bangladesh, however with the invention of man-made fibres during the 20th century, the jute industry went into decline. Bangladesh&apos;s other agricultural products include tea, rice, pulses, potatoes, fruit, milk and mustard, as well as industries such as cotton, engineering and chemical fertilisers. Its major trading partners include the UK, US, Germany, France, Italy, India, China, Singapore, Kuwait, Japan and Hong Kong. Over 75% of Bangladesh&apos;s export earning comes from the clothes industry, of which 90% of the 3 million workers are women.

Reasons why Bangladesh struggles to grow its economy include natural causes such as cyclones and flooding, but recently, there has been an increase in foreign investment which has boosted the country&apos;s economical growth. There has also been some improvement in growth due to Nobel prize winner Muhammad Yunus and his development of microcredit, which is an idea relating to small loans for countries of poverty as a prompt for developing entrepreneurship.</string>
		<key>energy</key>
		<string>As it stands, 88% of Bangladesh&apos;s power comes from natural gas, as well as much of the country&apos;s energy coming from traditional sources such as wood, crop residues, and also 19% from imported coal and oil - leaving only 2% from the renewable and green form of hydroelectricity. Measures are in place to improve the country&apos;s infrastucture, by modernising the road and rail systems, as well as plans for a bridge over the Jamuna to better connect areas of the country. The government has allowed the privatisation of some parts of the telecommunications sector in order to modernise the country&apos;s communication services, for example through the licensed privatisation of various cell phone services.</string>

		<string>The area that now makes up the country of Belarus was settled by Slavic tribes in the 6th century. Next came the Varangians, a group of Scandinavian and Slavs from the Baltics, who helped move the land towards the Kievan Rus&apos; State, which bgan in 862. With the death of its ruler, Prince Yaroslav the Wise, the state split into independent Ruthenian principalities, of which many suffered at the hands of a Mongol invasion and later became absorbed into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.
In 1386, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland merged in a personal union, which set in motion a sequence of developments which led to the formation of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1569. The Russians in a series of invasions tried to conquer the Kievan Rus&apos; lands, specifically Belarus and Ukraine, and in 1795 Poland and Lithuanian&apos;s union ended, which resulted in the division of Belarus - with Belarussian lands acquired by the Russian Empire under Catherine the Great and held until German occupation in World War I.

In 1918, supported by the Germans, Belarus first gained independence as the Belarussian People&apos;s Republic. However, following Germany&apos;s defeat, the BFR fell to the Red Army and became the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. After Russian occupation of Lithuania it became joint with that country, and then split between Poland and the Soviet at the end of the Polish-Soviet war in 1921. Subsequently, the newly created Byelorussian SSR became a founding member of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1922.

In 1939, the Soviet invaded Poland and annexed its eastern lands, including much of the Belorussian land still belonging to the Polish. Germany invaded the Soviet in 1941, with Byelorussia the worst hit soviet republic, remaining under Nazi occupation until 1944. 209 out of 290 cities were completely destroyed during those years, and a third of the population killed - especially Byelorussia&apos;s Jewish population which was devestated during the Holocaust and never recovered. It was not until 1971 that Belorussia regained the population it had had before the war. After the war, Byelorussia was key to the rebuilding of the Soviet Republic and was a western outpost for manufacturing in the USSR. Stalin took measures to ensure the Byelorussian SSR&apos;s isolation from Western influences, known as Sovietization. The Belarussian language was frowned upon in Russia, and after Stalin&apos;s death, his successor Khrushchev continued this trend. The Byelorussian SSR suffered nuclear fallout from the Chernobyl explosion in neighbouring Ukraine. Afterwards, the Belarussian people put forward a petition to Gorbachev protesting against the restrictions on their culture. This led to a move towards Belarussian independence; in 1990 the pro-independence Belarussian Popular Front gained support, and though they only took 10% of seats, the people were happy with this step forward. On July 29 1990 the country announced itself Sovereign, and with the support of the Soveit, changed its name tot eh Republic of Belarus. Shushkevich, the country&apos;s chairman, met with Russian president Boris Yeltsin to announce the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Since then, Lukashenko has been re-elected twice to the presidency of Belarus, in 2001 and 2006.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Belarus&apos; economy is still state-controlled, as it was in Soviet times, and main exports include heavy machinery, agricultural products and energy. Other industries of importance are wood processing and textiles. Almost half the trade in Belarus takes place with Russia, its main trading partner. Around 25% of the workforce is employed in industry, but agriculture and service are also important sectors. For energy, the country relies on oil import from neighbouring Russia. </string>
		<key>culture</key>
		<string>Language
Belarusian is the official language of Belarus, and is spoken by about 40% of the population, with others speaking Russian. The language is a  member of the East Slavonic languages, sharing many features of grammar and lexicography, and was preceded up to the 19th century by Old Belarusian. It uses a form of the Cyrillic alphabet, with the modern version formulated in 1918 and comprising of 32 letters. As well as the standard norm, there are two varying dialects spoken in Belarus. The language has gone through several transformations, evolving gradually and changing as the country was annexed and occupied by neighbouring countries.
Literature
Belarus has a long standing tradition of literature, starting in the 11th to 13th centuries with religious writing, such as the poetry of Cyril of Turaw. In the 16th century, Francysk Skaryna translated the Bible into Belarusian, making it the first book printed anywhere in Eastern Europe. Kupala in the late 19th century heralded in the modern period in Belarusian literature; he was followed by writers such as Svayak, Kolas and Biadula. However, once taken over by Soviet control, and latterly Nazi occupation, cultural freedoms were greatly restricted, and many writers fled the country during the Second World War. The last revival of literature in Belarus occurred in the 1960s with works published by Bykau and Karatkievic. 
Music
The first Belarusian ballet to be performed by the Bolshoi Ballet Theatre in Minsk was Nightingale by Kroshner, and was performed during the Soviet era. After the Great Patriotic War, the term used to use Belarus and the Soviet&apos;s part in the war against Germany, music focused on the hardships of the people who took up arms in defending their country. Although there is an underground movement of rock music which has developed in the past years, the Belarusian government has taken measures to suppress its development.
Cuisine
Belarusian meals consist mostly of meat, vegetables and breads, and are mostly stewed or slow-cooked. The Russian wheat vodka and soft drink kvass are popular, the latter being combined with sliced vegetables and served with a cold soup called okroshka.</string>

		<key>about</key>
		<string>The Kingdom of Belgium is a country in northwest Europe. It is a founding member of the European Union and hosts its headquarters, as well as those of other major international organizations, including NATO.  Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home for two main linguistic groups, the Flemings and the French-speakers, mostly Walloons, plus a small group of German-speakers.

Belgium&apos;s two largest regions are the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders in the north, with 59% of the population, and the French-speaking southern region of Wallonia, inhabited by 31%. The Brussels-Capital Region, officially bilingual, is a mostly French-speaking enclave within the Flemish Region and near the Walloon Region, and has 10% of the population.  A small German-speaking Community exists in eastern Wallonia.  Belgium&apos;s linguistic diversity and related political and cultural conflicts are reflected in the political history and a complex system of government.
 
The name &apos;Belgium&apos; is derived from Gallia Belgica, a Roman province in the northernmost part of Gaul that was inhabited by the Belgae, a mix of Celtic and Germanic peoples.  Historically, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg were known as the Low Countries, which used to cover a somewhat larger area than the current Benelux group of states. From the end of the Middle Ages until the 17th century, it was a prosperous centre of commerce and culture. From the 16th century until the Belgian revolution in 1830, many battles between European powers were fought in the area of Belgium, a reputation strengthened by both World Wars. Upon its independence, Belgium eagerly participated in the Industrial Revolution,and, at the end of the nineteenth century, possessed several colonies in Africa.  The second half of the 20th century was marked by the rise of communal conflicts between the Flemings and the Francophones fuelled by cultural differences on the one hand and an asymmetrical economic evolution of Flanders and Wallonia on the other hand. These still-active conflicts have caused far-reaching reforms of the unitary Belgian state into a federal state.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Belgium was one of the founding members of the EU, and has a strong, open economy. Much of its workforce is employed in the service sectors, and key industries include engineering, metal, transportation equipment, textiles, glass and petroleum. It has a high GDP, of approximately $376 billion, and its major trade partners include Germany, UK, US, France, Italy and the Netherlands.</string>
		<key>culture</key>
		<string>Belgium is famous for fine beers, particularly that brewed by the Trappist monks. Only six or seven monasteries in Belgium are able to brew the beer, and it is a national speciality. There are also many dishes that are typical of Belgian cuisine, such as Brussels waffles and Belgian pralines.

		<string>Benin, officially the Republic of Benin and formerly Dahomey, is a country in West Africa. It is bordered by Togo to the west, by Nigeria to the east and byBurkina Faso and Niger to the north. A majority of the population live on its small southern coastline on the Bight of Benin, part of the Gulf of Guinea in the northernmost tropical portion of the Atlantic Ocean.The capital of Benin is Porto-Novo, but the seat of government is in Cotonou, the country&apos;s largest city and economic capital. Benin covers an area of approximately 115,000 square kilometers (42,000 sq mi), with a population of approximately 9.98 million. Benin is a tropical, sub-Saharan nation, highly dependent on agriculture, with substantial employment and income arising from subsistence farming.
The official language of Benin is French. However, indigenous languages such as Fon and Yoruba are commonly spoken. The largest religious group in Benin is Roman Catholicism, followed closely by Islam, Vodun andProtestantism. Benin is a member of the United Nations, the African Union, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone, La Francophonie, the Community of Sahel-Saharan States, the African Petroleum Producers Association and the Niger Basin Authority.
From the 17th to the 19th century, the main political entities in the area were the Kingdom of Dahomey along with the city-state of Porto-Novo and a large area with many different tribes to the north. This region was referred to as the Slave Coast from as early as the 17th century due to the large number of slaves shipped to the New World during the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. After slavery was abolished, France took over the country and renamed it French Dahomey. In 1960, Dahomey gained full independence from France, and had a tumultuous period with many different democratic governments, many military coups and military governments.
A Marxist-Leninist state called the People&apos;s Republic of Benin existed between 1975 and 1990. In 1991, it was replaced by the current multi-party Republic of Benin</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>French is the official language of Benin, as well as tribal languages and dialects Fon and Yoruba, which are spoken by a minority of people within the country.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Benin&apos;s economy is underdeveloped, with a GDP dependant on the production of cotton, as well as subsistence agriculture. Produce includes textiles, cocoa, maize, beans, rice, cashews, peanuts, pineapples, casasva, yams, as well as some fishing which is exported to Europe. Many previously government-run organisations and businesses have been privatised. The economy is in a period of transition, since the election of a democratic government in 1990, and following that a period of foreign investment. Much of Benin&apos;s exportation goes to France, and to a lesser extent to Korea, Japan and the Netherlands.

G8 debt reduction was announced in 2005, which has helped the country with its economic situation. Benin hopes to put emphasis on its service sector, through the tourist trade, and by this means attract foreign investment and business in the country. As well as this, it looks to develop its information technology and infrastructure. The country is a member of the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa.</string>
		<key>energy</key>
		<string>Benin is dependant on imported energy, predominantly from Ghana, and this makes up a significant percentage of the country&apos;s imports. To this end, Benin and neighbouring Togo are planning a joint hydroelectric project which will alleviate this dependance and also provide a more sustainable and secure energy future.</string>

		<string>Bhutan or the Kingdom of Bhutan is a landlocked nation in South Asia, located at the eastern end of the Himalaya Mountains and is bordered to the south, east and west by the Republic of India and to the north by Tibet.  Bhutan is known by its own people as &quot;Land of the Thunder Dragon&quot;.  Bhutan used to be one of the most isolated nations in the world, but developments including direct international flights, internet, mobile phone networks, and cable television have increasingly opened the doors. </string>
		<key>development</key>
		<string>Even though Bhutan is a very small nation, they have done extremely well for themselves, their economy is one of the world&apos;s smallest, yet it has grown rapidly in recent years, Bhutan had the second fastest growing economy in the world, with an annual economic growth rate of almost 25%%.  This was mainly due to the commissioning of the gigantic Tala Hydroelectricity project, which is one of the largest in the world, most of which is sold to India for  immense profits.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>The economy of Bhutan is mainly based on agriculture, forestry, tourism and the sale of hydroelectric power to India. Agriculture provides the main livelihood for more than 80 percent of the population. Agrarian practices consist largely of subsistence farming and animal husbandry. Handicrafts, particularly weaving and the manufacture of religious art for home altars, are a small cottage industry. A landscape that varies from hilly to ruggedly mountainous has made the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive. This, and a lack of access to the sea, has meant that Bhutan has not been able to benefit from significant trading of its produce, with the exception of hydroelectric power.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>In the future, Bhutan will look to continue to expand its economy, which is one of the fastest growing in the world.  Despite their extremely small size, the nation has had an overwhelming amount of success in recent years, particularly due to their hydroelectric production.  Furthermore, Bhutan looks to be one of the larger hydroelectric exporters in all of Asia, as they are already the number one supplier to India.  Bhutan is also looking to simplify the Bhutan Visa process in order to allow tourists more easily.</string>

		<string>Bolivia, officially The Republic of Bolivia is a landlocked country in central South America. It is bordered by Brazil to the north and east, Paraguay and Argentina to the south, and Chile and Peru to the west.  Prior to European colonization, the Bolivian territory was a part of the Incan Empire, which was the largest state in Pre-Columbian America. The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century. During most of the Spanish colonial period, this territory was called &quot;Upper Peru&quot; or &quot;Charcas&quot; and was under the administration of the Viceroyalty of Peru, which included most of Spain&apos;s South American colonies.

The Bolivian population, estimated at 9 million, is multiethnic, including Amerindians, Europeans, Asians and Africans. The main language spoken Spanish, although the Aymara and Quechua languages are also common. The large number of different cultures within Bolivia has contributed greatly to a wide diversity in fields such as art, cuisine, literature and music.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>Bolivia&apos;s ethnic distribution is estimated to be 30% Quechua-speaking and 25% Aymara-speaking Amerindians. The largest of the approximately three dozen native groups are the Quechuas (2.5 million), Aymaras (2 million), then Chiquitano (180,000), and Guaraní (125,000). So the full Amerindian population is at 55%; the remaining 30% is Mestizo (mixed Amerindian and European), and around 15% are Whites.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Bolivia has the lowest GDP per capita in South America. However, the country is rich in natural resources.Bolivia&apos;s 2002 gross domestic product (GDP) totaled USD $7.9 billion. Economic growth is about 2.5% per year, and inflation was expected to be between 3% and 4%.  Since 1985, the government of Bolivia has implemented a far-reaching program of macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform aimed at maintaining price stability, creating conditions for sustained growth, and alleviating scarcity. A major reform of the customs service in recent years has significantly improved transparency in this area. Parallel legislative reforms have locked into place market-liberal policies, especially in the hydrocarbon and telecommunication sectors, that have encouraged private investment. Foreign investors are accorded national treatment, and foreign ownership of companies enjoys virtually no restrictions in Bolivia.</string>
		<key>religion</key>
		<string>The great majority of Bolivians are Roman Catholic, although Protestant denominations are expanding rapidly.  According to a 2009 survey conducted by the National Statistical Institute, 78% of the population is Roman Catholic, 16% is Protestant and 3% follow other religions of Christian origin.  Islam practiced by the descendants of Middle Easterners is almost nonexistent. There is also a small Jewish community that is almost all Ashkenazi in origin.  Bolivia has no official relgion mandated by the state.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>Bolivia is indeed a small country, yet they will look to expand based on their wealth of natural resources and agricultural infrastructure.  Also the newly elected government has created a new policy based on economic reforms towards a progressive change.  This will aloow Bolivia to continue to grow and become a dominant agricultural producer in the Latin American community in the years to come.</string>

		<string>Botswana is a landlocked country located in Southern Africa. The citizens refer to themselves as Batswana (singular: Motswana).Formerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland, Botswana adopted its new name after becoming independent within the Commonwealth on 30 September 1966. Since then, it has maintained a strong tradition as a stablerepresentative democracy, with a consistent record of uninterrupted democratic elections.
Geographically, Botswana is flat, with up to 70 percent of its territory being the Kalahari Desert. It is bordered by South Africa to the south and southeast, Namibia to the west and north, and Zimbabwe to the northeast. Its border with Zambia to the north near Kazungula is poorly defined but at most is a few hundred metres long.
A mid-sized country of just over two million people, Botswana is one of the most sparsely populated nations in the world. Around 10 percent of the population lives in the capital and largest city, Gaborone. Once one of the poorest countries in the world—with a GDP per capita of about US$70 per year in the late 1960s—Botswana has since transformed itself into one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, now boasting a GDP (purchasing power parity) per capita of about $16,400 per year as of 2013. Its high gross national income (by some estimates the fourth-largest in Africa) gives the country a modest standard of living and the highest Human Development Index of continental Sub-Saharan Africa.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>Tswana, a Bantu language written in the latin alphabet, is the official language of Botswana. As a language it is most closely related to Sesotho and Northern Sotho. In the past, it has also been referred to as Beetjuans, Chuana, Coana, Cuana and Sechuana. English is another widely spoken language in Botswana.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Botswana&apos;s growth rate between 1966 and 1999 was 9% per year, the highest in the world. Ranked as the least corrupt country in Africa, and with a standard of living approximating to that of Turkey or Mexico, Botswana&apos;s has built its economic success on diamond mining as well as help from international partners, and prudent fiscal and foreign policies. However, despite this expansion, the devestation caused by AIDS has led to economic turmoil in recent years - with one in six Botswana having HIV.

Agriculture makes up a large proportion of the workforce, employed in producing livestock, maize, beans, groundnut oil. Industries in the country include diamond mining, copper, salt, nickel, textiles and potash. Botswan&apos;s major trading partners are the European Free Trade Association, the Southern African Customs Union, and Zimbabwe.</string>
		<key>tourism</key>
		<string>Tourism is a very important sector in Botswana, accounting for a significant percentage of the country&apos;s GDP. The country has many game and safari reserves which attract many visitors, including the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, Moremi Game Reserve and Chobe National Park. The Okavango Delta is one of the world&apos;s unique ecosystems, and elsewhere in the country are the world&apos;s largest herds of roaming elephants. The country is also trying to involve village communities in tourism through natural resource management projects, for example in the Khwai Development Trust. Since Alexander McCall Smith&apos;s series of books on the No 1 Ladies&apos; Detective Agency - set in Botswana - the country has seen an upsurge in tourism.</string>

		<string>Portuguese is the official language of Brazil, it is spoken by almost all of the population and is virtually the only language used in newspapers, radio, television, and for all business and administrative purposes, with the exception of Nheengatu, an indigenous language of South America which was granted co-official status alongside Portuguese in the municipality of São Gabriel da Cachoeira. Moreover, Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas, making the language an important part of Brazilian national identity and giving it a national culture distinct from its Spanish-speaking neighbors.  Brazilian Portuguese has had its own development, influenced by the Amerindian and African languages.  Due to this, the language is somewhat different from that spoken in Portugal and other Portuguese-speaking countries, mainly for phonological and orthographic differences. These differences are somewhat greater than those of American and British English. 
Minority languages are spoken throughout the vast national territory. Some of these are spoken by indigenous peoples: 180 Amerindian languages are spoken in remote areas. Others are spoken by immigrants and their descendants. There are important communities of speakers of German and Italian in the south of the country, both largely influenced by the Portuguese language.</string>
		<key>climate</key>
		<string>The climate of Brazil comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a large geographic scale and varied topography, but the largest part of the country is tropical.  Brazil hosts five major climatic subtypes: equatorial, tropical, semiarid, highland tropical, and temperate; ranging from equatorial rainforests in the north and semiarid deserts in the northeast, to temperate coniferous forests in the south and tropical savannas in central Brazil.</string>

		<string>Burmese, the mother tongue of the Bamar and official language of Burma, is related to Tibetan and to the Chinese languages.  It is written in a script consisting of circular and semi-circular letters, which were adapted from the Mon script, which in turn was developed from a southern Indian script in the 700s. The earliest known inscriptions in the Burmese script date from the 1000s. It is also used to write Pali, the sacred language of Theravada Buddhism, as well as several ethnic minority languages, including Shan, several Karen dialects, and Kayah (Karenni), with the addition of specialised characters and diacritics for each language.

		<string>Burundi, is a landlocked country in the African Great Lakes region of Southeast Africa, bordered by Rwanda to the north, Tanzania to the east and south, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west. It is also sometimes considered part of Central Africa. Burundi&apos;s capital isBujumbura. Although the country is landlocked, much of the southwestern border is adjacent to Lake Tanganyika.
The Tea, Hutu and Tutsi peoples have lived in Burundi for at least five hundred years. For more than 200 years, Burundi had an indigenous kingdom. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Germany colonized the region. After the First World War and its defeat, it ceded the territory to Belgium. The latter ruled Burundi and Rwanda as a European colony known as Ruanda-Urundi. Their intervention exacerbated social differences between the Tutsi and Hutu, which contributed to political unrest in the region. There was civil war in Burundi as it fought for independence in the middle of the twentieth century. Presently, Burundi is governed as a presidentialrepresentative democratic republic.
Burundi is one of the five poorest countries in the world. It has one of the lowest per capita GDPs of any nation in the world. The country has suffered from warfare, corruption and poor access to education. Burundi is densely populated and has had substantial emigration as young people seek opportunities elsewhere. According to a 2012 DHL Global Connectedness Index, Burundi is the least globalized of 140 surveyed countries.
According to the Global Hunger Index of 2013, Burundi has an indicator ratio of 38.8, earning the nation the distinction of being the hungriest country in the world in terms of percentage.

		<string>Barbados is a sovereign island country in the Lesser Antilles. It is 34 kilometres (21 mi) in length and up to 23 kilometres (14 mi) in width, covering an area of 432 square kilometres (167 sq mi). It is situated in the western area of the North Atlantic and 100 kilometres (62 mi) east of the Windward Islands and the Caribbean Sea;therein, it is about 168 kilometres (104 mi) east of the islands of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and 400 kilometres (250 mi) north-east of Trinidad and Tobago. Barbados is outside of the principal Atlantic hurricane belt.
Barbados was visited by Spanish navigators in the late 15th century and claimed for the Spanish Crown. It first appears on a Spanish map from 1511.The Portuguese visited the island in 1536, but they left it unclaimed, with their only remnants being an introduction of wild hogs for a good supply of meat whenever the island was visited. An English ship, the Olive Blossom, arrived in Barbados in 1625; its men took possession of it in the name ofKing James I. In 1627 the first permanent settlers arrived from England, and it became an English and later British colony.
In 1966 Barbados became an independent state and Commonwealth realm, retaining Queen Elizabeth II as Head of State. It has a population of 277,821 people, mostly of African descent. Despite being classified as an Atlantic island, Barbados is considered to be a part of the Caribbean, where it is ranked as a leading tourist destination. In 2014 Barbados ranked second in the Americas (after Canada) and 17th globally (after Belgium andJapan) on Transparency International&apos;s Corruption Perception Index.</string>

		<string>Saint-Barthélemy, is an overseas collectivity ofFrance. Often abbreviated to Saint-Barth in French, or St. Barts or St. Barths in English, the indigenous people called the island Ouanalao.St. Barthélemy lies about 35 kilometres (22 mi) southeast of St. Martin and north of St. Kitts. Puerto Rico is 240 kilometres (150 mi) to the west in the Greater Antilles.
Saint Barthélemy was for many years a French commune forming part of Guadeloupe, which is an overseas region and department of France. In 2003, the island voted in favour of secession from Guadeloupe in order to form a separate overseas collectivity (COM) of France. The collectivity is one of four territories among the Leeward Islands in the northeastern Caribbean that comprise the French West Indies, along with Saint Martin,Guadeloupe (200 kilometres (120 mi) southeast), and Martinique.
Saint Barthélemy, a volcanic island fully encircled by shallow reefs, has an area of 25 square kilometres (9.7 sq mi) and a population of 9,035 (Jan. 2011 estimate). Its capital is Gustavia, which also contains the main harbour to the island. It is the only Caribbean island which was a Swedish colony for any significant length of time; Guadeloupe was under Swedish rule only briefly at the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Symbolism from theSwedish national arms, the Three Crowns, still appears in the island&apos;s coat of arms. The language, cuisine, and culture, however, are distinctly French. The island is a popular tourist destination during the winter holiday season, especially for the rich and famous during the Christmas and new year period.</string>

		<string>Bermuda, also referred to in legal documents as the Bermudas or Somers Isles,is a British Overseas Territory in the North Atlantic Ocean, located off the east coast of North America. Its nearestlandmass is Cape Hatteras, United States, about 1,030 kilometres (640 mi) to the west-northwest. It is about 1,239 kilometres (770 mi) south of Cape Sable Island, Canada, and 1,538 kilometres (956 mi) north of Puerto Rico. Its capital city is Hamilton.
The first known European explorer to reach Bermuda was Spanish sea captain Juan de Bermúdez in 1503, after whom the islands are named. He claimed the apparently uninhabited islands for the Spanish Empire. Although he paid two visits to the archipelago, Bermúdez never landed on the islands, because he did not want to risk crossing over the dangerous reef surrounding them. Subsequent Spanish or other European parties are believed to have released pigs there, which had become feral and abundant on the island by the time European settlement began. In 1609, the English Virginia Company, which had established Virginia and Jamestown on the North American continent two years earlier, established a settlement. It was founded in the aftermath of a hurricane, when the crew of the sinking Sea Venture steered the ship onto the reef so they could get ashore.
The island was administered as an extension of Virginia by the Company until 1614, when its successor, the Somers Isles Company, took over and managed it until 1684. At that time, the company&apos;s charter was revoked, and the English Crown took over administration. The islands became a British colony following the 1707 unification of the parliaments of Scotland and England, which created the Kingdom of Great Britain. After 1949, whenNewfoundland became part of Canada, Bermuda was automatically ranked as the oldest remaining British Overseas Territory. Since the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997, it is the most populous Territory. Its first capital,St. George&apos;s, was established in 1612 and is the oldest continuously inhabited English town in the New World.
Bermuda&apos;s economy is based on offshore insurance and reinsurance, and tourism, the two largest economic sectors.Bermuda had one of the world&apos;s highest GDP per capita for most of the 20th century[citation needed]and several years beyond. Recently, its economic status has been affected by the global recession. It has a subtropical climate.[12] Bermuda is the northernmost point of the Bermuda Triangle, a region of sea in which, according to legend, a number of aircraft and surface vessels have disappeared under supposedly unexplained or mysterious circumstances. The island is in the hurricane belt and prone to severe weather.</string>

		<string>The Bahamas , officially the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, is an island country of the Lucayan Archipelago consisting of more than 700 islands, cays, and islets in the Atlantic Ocean; north of Cuba and Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic); northwest of the Turks and Caicos Islands; southeast of the U.S. state of Florida and east of the Florida Keys. Its capital isNassau on the island of New Providence. The designation of &quot;Bahamas&quot; can refer to either the country or the larger island chain that it shares with the Turks and Caicos Islands. As stated in the mandate/manifesto of theRoyal Bahamas Defence Force, the Bahamas territory encompasses 470,000 km2 (180,000 sq mi) of ocean space.
Originally inhabited by the Lucayan, a branch of the Arawakan-speaking Taino people, the Bahamas were the site of Columbus&apos; first landfall in the New World in 1492. Although the Spanish never colonized the Bahamas, they shipped the native Lucayans to slavery in Hispaniola. The islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648, when English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera.
The Bahamas became a British Crown colony in 1718, when the British clamped down on piracy. After the American War of Independence, the Crown resettled thousands of American Loyalists in the Bahamas; they brought their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants. Blacks comprised the majority of the population from this period. The Bahamas became a haven for freed black slaves: the Royal Navy resettled Africans here liberated from illegal slave ships; American slaves and Black Seminoles escaped here from Florida; and the government freed American slaves carried on United States domestic ships that had reached the Bahamas due to weather. Slavery in the Bahamas was abolished in 1834. Today the descendants of slaves and free Africans make up nearly 90 percent of the population; issues related to the slavery years are part of society.
The Bahamas became an independent Commonwealth realm in 1973, retaining Queen Elizabeth II as its monarch. In terms of gross domestic product per capita, the Bahamas is one of the richest countries in the Americas(following the United States and Canada). Its economy is based on tourism and finance.</string>

It is the only country in Central America whose official language is English, though Belizean Creole (Kriol) and Spanish are also commonly spoken. Belize is bordered on the north by Mexico, on the south and west by Guatemala, and on the east by the Caribbean Sea. Its mainland is about 290 km (180 mi) long and 110 km (68 mi) wide.
With 22,800 square kilometres (8,800 sq mi) of land and as of 2014 a population of 340,844, Belize has the lowest population density in Central America. The country&apos;s population growth rate of 1.97% per year (2013) is the second highest in the region and one of the highest in the Western Hemisphere.
Belize&apos;s abundance of terrestrial and marine species and its diversity of ecosystems give it a key place in the globally significant Mesoamerican Biological Corridor.
Belize has a diverse society, composed of many cultures and languages that reflect its rich history. Originally part of the British Empire, it shares a common colonial history with other Anglophone Caribbean countries. From 1862 to 1973 the area went by the name of British Honduras. It became an independent Commonwealth realm in 1981, retaining Queen Elizabeth II as head of state.
Belize is considered a Central American and Caribbean nation with strong ties to both the Latin American and Caribbean region. It is a member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), and the Central American Integration System (SICA), the only country to hold full membership in all three regional organisations.
Belize is known for its September Celebrations, and is the birthplace of chewing gum and punta music.</string>

The Cook Islands&apos; Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), however, covers 1,800,000 square kilometres (690,000 sq mi) of ocean.
The Cook Islands&apos; defence and foreign affairs are the responsibility of New Zealand, which is exercised in consultation with the Cook Islands. In recent times, the Cook Islands have adopted an increasingly independent foreign policy. Although Cook Islanders are citizens of New Zealand, they have the status of Cook Islands nationals, which is not given to other New Zealand citizens.
The Cook Islands&apos; main population centres are on the island of Rarotonga (10,572 in 2011), where there is an international airport. There is a larger population of Cook Islanders in New Zealand, particularly the North Island. In the 2006 census, 58,008 self-identified as being of ethnic Cook Islands Māori descent.
With about 100,000 visitors travelling to the islands in the 2010–11 financial year, tourism is the country&apos;s main industry, and the leading element of the economy, ahead of offshore banking, pearls, and marine and fruit exports.</string>

		<string>Cameroon, officially the Republic of Cameroon, is a country in Central Africa. It is bordered by Nigeria to the west; Chad to the northeast; the Central African Republic to the east; and Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and the Republic of the Congo to the south. Cameroon&apos;s coastline lies on the Bight of Bonny, part of the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean. The country is often referred to as &quot;Africa in miniature&quot; for its geological and cultural diversity. Natural features include beaches, deserts, mountains, rainforests, and savannas. The highest point is Mount Cameroon in the southwest, and the largest cities are Douala, Yaoundé, and Garoua. Cameroon is home to over 200 different linguistic groups. The country is well known for its native styles of music, particularly makossa and bikutsi, and for its successful national football team. French and English are the official languages. After independence, the newly united nation joined the Commonwealth of Nations, although the vast majority of its territories had previously been a German colony and, after World War I, a French mandate.
Early inhabitants of the territory included the Sao civilisation around Lake Chad and the Baka hunter-gatherers in the southeastern rainforest. Portuguese explorers reached the coast in the 15th century and named the area Rio dos Camarões (Shrimp River), which became Cameroon in English. Fulani soldiers founded the Adamawa Emirate in the north in the 19th century, and various ethnic groups of the west and northwest established powerful chiefdoms and fondoms. Cameroon became a German colony in 1884 known as Kamerun.
After World War I, the territory was divided between France and Britain as League of Nations mandates. The Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC) political party advocated independence, but was outlawed by France in the 1950s. It waged war on French and UPC militant forces until 1971. In 1960, the French-administered part of Cameroon became independent as the Republic of Cameroun under President Ahmadou Ahidjo. The southern part of British Cameroons merged with it in 1961 to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon. The country was renamed the United Republic of Cameroon in 1972 and the Republic of Cameroon in 1984.
Cameroon enjoys relatively high political and social stability. This has permitted the development of agriculture, roads, railways, and large petroleum and timber industries. Nevertheless, large numbers of Cameroonians live in poverty as subsistence farmers. Power lies firmly in the hands of the authoritarian president since 1982, Paul Biya, and his Cameroon People&apos;s Democratic Movement party. The English-speaking territories of Cameroon have grown increasingly alienated from the government, and politicians from those regions have called for greater decentralization and even secession (for example: the Southern Cameroons National Council) of the former British-governed territories.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>Although French and English are the official languages of Cameroon, the country is home to 230 languages, made up of Afro-Asiatic, Nilo-Saharan and Niger-Congo. Although - due to the country&apos;s colonial past - Cameroon strives to be bilingual, in fact few citizens speak both languages, and some speak neither. In the northwest and southwest, most people speak Cameroonian Pidgin English, in the north, Fulfulde, and in the centre, south and east, Ewondo. Camfranglais is a new pidgin form of dialect, used in urban areas.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Cameroon has a relatively prosperous economy for an African state, enjoying strong trade relations with France, Italy, South Korea, Spain and the UK. Cameroon&apos;s is the dominant economy within the Bank of Central African States, and is also part of the Customs and Economic Union of South Africa, and the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa. Under direction by the World Bank and the IMF, Cameroon has been following programmes to privatise, reduce poverty and increase economic growth.

Much of Cameroon&apos;s GDP comes from agriculture and forestry, because of the nature of its climate. There is commercial cultivation of bananas, cocoa, palm oil, tea, rubber, coffee, sugar and tobacco, as well as livestock and seafood. Logging is another key industry, and is managed carefully to ensure it is done in a sustainable way. Tourism is an increasingly important industry in Cameroon, especially in the country&apos;s coastal areas.</string>
		<key>energy</key>
		<string>Petroleum refinery is still a key industry in the country, although levels have dropped in the past ten years. Rapids and waterfalls create the perfect setting for harvesting hydroelectric energy - which provides most of Cameroon&apos;s power, and has the added bonus that it is an environmental and sustainable form of energy production. The remainder of the country&apos;s energy comes from oil-powered thermal engines.</string>
		<key>culture</key>
		<string>Music and dance are an important part of Cameroon festivities, with traditional dances and the use of a variety of instruments. Pop music is another popular form of entertainment, and much of it is informed by Nigerian music. Film and TV focus on European and African themes, while crafts such as basket making and jewellery are particularly popular. Sport is advocated by national policy, for example wrestling, canoe racing, as well as running and football.</string>

The offiical language is Standard Manadarin or Putonghua, although various administrative centres use different languages which take on official status, for example Mongolian, Cantonese and Tibetan. However, it is seen to be economically and practically useful to speak Mandarin, and as well as this, English is gaining prestige across the country - with a reported one fifth of the country learning to speak English. The spoken languages across PR China belong to the following families: Sino-Tibetan, Altaic, Austrolasiatic, Kradai, Indo-European, Austronesian.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>China&apos;s global importance is unambiguous, it has the world&apos;s largest economy and is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, as well as WTO, APEC, Shanghai Cooperation Organization and East Asia Summit. It has the world&apos;s largest army and the second biggest defense budget. It is also has one of the quickest growing economies, and is a huge exporter and importer of goods. Economic liberalisation in 1978 has meant that China&apos;s economy has shifted from centrally planned to market oriented and mixed economy. The state still has its pillar industries, for example energy and heavy industries, but as well as this private enterprise now accounts for a huge percentage of the country&apos;s output. Agriculture is still a key industry, with produce including rice, potatoes, wheat, tea, peanuts, applese, cotton, oilseed and fish. Major industries include mining and ore processing, iron, steel and metal processing, coal, fertilisers, transportation equipment such as motor vehicle and shipbuilding, satellites and textiles. China&apos;s main trading partners are the US, Japan, Germany and Taiwan.</string>
		<key>energy</key>
		<string>China&apos;s economy, understandably due to its size, is extremely energy inefficient, using considerably more energy for industrial processes than OECD countries. It is the second largest energy consumer, coming behind the US. China relies on coal for a large proportion of its energy needs, and without sufficient environmentally conscious measures in place, this has led to severe air and water pollution. To this end, the government has agreed to use greater levels of renewable energy in the future, with a target of 30% by 2050. The country is developing its own renewable energy sources, such as hydro, wind and solar power, as well as pebble bed nuclear reactors.</string>

		<string>China, officially the People&apos;s Republic of China (PRC), is a sovereign state located in East Asia. It is the world&apos;s most populous country, with a population of over 1.35 billion. The PRC is a single-party state governed by the Chinese Communist Party, with its seat of government in the capital city of Beijing.It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, fiveautonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau). The PRC also claims the territoriesgoverned by the Republic of China (ROC), a separate political entity commonly known as Taiwan, as a part of its territory, which includes the island of Taiwan as Taiwan Province, Kinmen and Matsu as a part of Fujian Province and islands the ROC controls in the South China Sea as a part of Hainan Province. These claims are controversial due to the complex political status of Taiwan.
Covering approximately 9.6 million square kilometers, China is the world&apos;s second-largest country by land area, and either the third or fourth-largest by total area, depending on the method of measurement. China&apos;s landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from forest steppes and the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts in the arid north to subtropical forests in the wetter south. The Himalaya, Karakoram, Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges separate China from South and Central Asia. The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, run from the Tibetan Plateau to the densely populated eastern seaboard. China&apos;s coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500 kilometres (9,000 mi) long, and is bounded by the Bohai, Yellow, East and South China Seas.
The history of China goes back to its ancient civilization – one of the world&apos;s earliest – that flourished in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain. For millennia, China&apos;s political system was based on hereditary monarchies, known as dynasties, beginning with the semi-mythological Xia of the Yellow River basin (c. 2800 BCE). Since 221 BCE, when the Qin Dynasty first conquered several states to form a Chinese empire, the country has expanded, fractured and been reformed numerous times. The Republic of China (ROC) overthrew the last dynasty in 1911, and ruled the Chinese mainland until 1949. After the surrender of the Empire of Japan in World War II, the Communist Party defeated the nationalist Kuomintang in mainland China and established the People&apos;s Republic of China in Beijing on 1 October 1949, while the Kuomintang relocated the ROC government to its present capital of Taipei.</string>

		<string>Colombia is a country in north-western South America. Colombia is bordered to the east by Venezuela and Brazil, to the south by Ecuador and Peru, to the north by the Caribbean Sea, to the north west by Panama and to the west by the Pacific Ocean. Colombia also shares maritime borders with Jamaica, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica.  Colombia is the 26th largest nation in the world and the fourth largest in South America (after Brazil, Argentina, and Peru). It has the 29th largest population in the world and the second largest in South America, after Brazil. Colombia has the third largest Spanish-speaking population in the world after Mexico and Spain.</string>
		<key>climate</key>
		<string>The climate of Colombia is primarily determined by its proximity to the equator, with tropical and isothermal climate predominating. Other influences are the trade winds and the effect of the Intertropical Convergence Zone on precipitation. Colombia is also affected by the El Niño and La Niña phenomena.  Colombia&apos;s Pacific coast has one of the highest levels of rainfall in the world, with the south east often drenched by more than 200 in (500 cm) of rain per year.  Global warming climate changes have made these extreme weather situations even more intense and threaten the vast coastline of Colombia. </string>
		<key>environmental</key>
		<string>The environmental challenges faced by Colombia are caused by both natural hazards and human agency. Many natural hazards result from Colombia&apos;s position along the Pacific Ring of Fire and the consequent geological instability. Colombia has 15 major volcanoes, the eruptions of which have on occasion resulted in substantial loss of life, such as at Armero in 1985, and geological faults that have caused numerous devastating earthquakes, such as the 1999 Armenia earthquake. Heavy floods both in mountainous areas and in low-lying watersheds and coastal regions regularly cause deaths and considerable damage to property during the rainy seasons. Rainfall intensities vary with the El Niño Southern Oscillation which occurs in unpredictable cycles, at times causing especially severe flooding.

Human induced deforestation has substantially changed the Andean landscape and is creeping into the rainforests of Amazonia and the Pacific coast. Deforestation is also linked to the conversion of lowland tropical forests to oil palm plantations. </string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>In spite of the difficulties presented by serious internal armed conflict, Colombia&apos;s economy grew steadily in the latter part of the twentieth century, with gross domestic product (GDP) increasing at an average rate of over 4% per year between 1970 and 1998.  The Colombian economy continues to be one of the fastest growing economies in South America and has been steadily growing over the past two decades.  Furthermore, the Colombian stock exchange climbed from 1,000 points at its creation in July 2001 to over 7,300 points by November 2009.</string>
		<key>transportation</key>
		<string>Colombia has a network of national highways maintained by the Instituto Nacional de Vías or INVIAS (National Institute of Roadways) government agency under the Ministry of Transport. The Pan-American Highway travels through Colombia, connecting the country with Venezuela to the east and Ecuador to the south.  Colombia&apos;s principal airport is El Dorado International Airport in Bogotá. Several national airlines and international airlines operate from El Dorado. Because of its central location in Colombia and America, it is preferred by national land transportation providers, as well as national and international air transportation providers.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>Colombia will look to continue to grow in the near future, partly because of its wealth of natural resources, but also because of the economic reform policies enacted by the government.  Also Colombia has become a leader in South America in terms of renewable energy research and cliamte change/global warming research.</string>

Costa Rica was sparsely inhabited by indigenous people before coming under Spanish rule in the 16th century. It remained a peripheral colony of the empire until independence as part of the short-lived First Mexican Empire, followed by membership in the United Provinces of Central America, from which it formally declared sovereignty in 1847. Since then, Costa Rica has remained among the most stable, prosperous, and progressive nations in Latin America.

		<string>Cape Verde, officially the Republic of Cabo Verde, is an island country spanning an archipelago of 10 volcanic islands in the central Atlantic Ocean. Located 570 kilometres (350 mi) off the coast of Western Africa, the islands cover a combined area of slightly over 4,000 square kilometres (1,500 sq mi).
Portuguese explorers discovered and colonized the uninhabited islands in the 15th century, the first European settlement in the tropics. Ideally located for the Atlantic slave trade, the islands grew prosperous and often attractedprivateers and pirates, among them Sir Francis Drake in the 1580s. The islands were also visited by Charles Darwin during FitzRoy&apos;s Beagle voyage in 1832. The islands were settled as the colony grew in importance on the main shipping lanes from Europe to India and Australia, and population increased steadily.
At the time of independence from Portugal in 1975, Cape Verdeans emigrated across the world, such that the population in the 21st century of over half a million people on the islands is equaled by the diaspora in Europe, the Americas, and on the African continent. The Cape Verdean economy is mostly service-oriented with a growing focus on tourism and foreign investment.
The country is known for the Cape Verdean type hurricanes that form off the coast of the archipelago islands. While many move harmlessly out to sea, some move across the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, becoming damaging storms for Caribbean nations, Central America, Mexico, Bermuda, the United States, and occasionally even Canada.
Historically, the name &quot;Cape Verde&quot; has been used in English for the archipelago and, since independence in 1975, for the country. In 2013, the Cape Verdean government determined that the Portuguese designation &quot;Cabo Verde&quot; would henceforth be used for official purposes, such as at the United Nations, even in English contexts.</string>

		<string>Although Portuguese is the offiical language of Cape Verde, the mother tongue of almost the whole population is in fact the Portuguese derived Cape Verdean Creole, shortened simply to Creole by its speakers. Also, despite Cape Verde&apos;s small size, there are still around nine distinct versions of Cape Verdean Creole, each different enough to be considered separate dialects: Brava, Fogo, Santiago, Maio, Boa Vista, Sal, Sao Nicolau, Sao Vicente and Santo Antao.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Formed from a series of islands making up an island archipelago, Cape Verde has limited natural resources, and only four out of its ten islands support agriculture. However, some mineral resources include salt and limestone. Around 90% of Cape Verde&apos;s food is imported. The service industry is the country&apos;s leading economic sector, with industries such as commerce, transport and public service dominating. Small amounts of fish and seafood are exported, and apart from this light manufacture makes up the remainder of the export. Recently, the country has embraced foreign investment, and has also privatised many previously government-run areas, in order to promote its market economy. Tourism is another expanding sector of the economy. Politically and economically, Cape Verde is closely aligned with Portuguese policies. Cape Verde is a member of the World Trade Organization.</string>
		<key>geography</key>
		<string>Cape Verde has an extremely biodiverse ecosystem, with volcanic mountains and a milder climate than the neighbouring African mainland. There is a variety of endemic species - of which many are endangered - including Raso Lark and Alexander&apos;s Swift.</string>

		<string>Canada is a country in North America consisting of ten provinces and three territories. Located in the northern part of the continent, it extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean. Covering 9.98 million square kilometres in total, Canada is the world&apos;s second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Its common border with the United States forms the world&apos;s longest land border.
The land that is now Canada has been inhabited for millennia by various Aboriginal peoples. Beginning in the late 15th century, British and French colonies were established on the region&apos;s Atlantic coast. As a consequence ofvarious conflicts, the United Kingdom gained and lost North American territories until left, in the late 18th century, with what mostly comprises Canada today. Pursuant to the British North America Act, on July 1, 1867, three colonies joined to form the autonomous federal Dominion of Canada. This began an accretion of provinces and territories to the new self-governing Dominion. In 1931, Britain granted Canada near total independence with theStatute of Westminster 1931 and full sovereignty was attained when the Canada Act 1982 severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the British parliament.
Canada is a federal parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, Queen Elizabeth II being the current head of state. The country is officially bilingual at the federal level. It is one of the world&apos;s most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries, with a population of approximately 35 million as of 2015. Its advanced economy is one of the largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada&apos;s long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture.
Canada is a developed country and one of the wealthiest in the world, with the tenth highest nominal per capita income globally, and the eighth highest ranking in the Human Development Index. It ranks among the highest in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, and education. Canada is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, and is furthermore part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings, including NATO, the G8, the Group of Ten, the G20, the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>English and French are spoken by 61% and 21% respectively, and are recognised by the Constitution of Canada as official languages. The most widely non-official spoken languages in Canada are Chinese, Punjabi, Spanish, Italian and Arabic. In 2006, over 6.6 million Canadians spoke French at home, of which over 90% lived in Quebec. Bi- and multilingualism are key features of Canadian society. There are several Canadian dialects of European languages, including Canadian Gaelic, Welsh, Newfoundland Irish, Acadian French, Canadian Ukrainian and Bungee.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>One of the world&apos;s richest nations, Canada is member of the OECD and G8 - within the G8 it has the lowest debt burden - and is one of the world&apos;s top ten trading nations. Its mixed-market economy has been growing rapidly since the 1990s, and now, Canada is very similar to the US, due to its market-oriented economic system and high standards of life. The expansion of the industry and service sectors, in particular manufacture and mining, has led to Canada having a $364 billion export industry, and a thriving industrial and urban economy. Logging and oil are vital industries, and Canada is unique among developed nations in being a key exporter of energy, for example Atlantic Canada which has vast deposits of offshore gas and oil. Canada also has a significant role as supplier of agricultural goods, for example wheat and grains, and at the other end of the spectrum, it is an important figure in the automobile and aeronautics industries.</string>
		<key>energy</key>
		<string>Unusually among developed countries, Canada is a chief exporter of energy, for example oil and natural gas, as well as renewable forms such as hydroelectricity. Canada was active in the talks which led to the founding of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. Canda&apos;s targets for reducing GHG emissions will in the future very likely be focused upon improving three areas: transportation, electricity production and fossil fuels.</string>

		<string>Chad, also known as the Republic of Chad, is a landlocked country in central Africa. It is bordered by Libya to the north, Sudan to the east, the Central African Republic to the south, Cameroon and Nigeria to the southwest, and Niger to the west.  Chad is referred to as &quot;The Heart of Africa&quot; because of its central location in the continent.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Chad is currently a country member of the Bank of Central African States, Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa and the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa.  Furthermore, starting in 2000, an oil industry project was started, mainly by foreign investment, and this has had a tremendous effect on Chad&apos;s economy</string>
		<key>agriculture</key>
		<string>Chad relies heavily on agriculture and particularly livestock for its well being economically.  Nearly 85% of the total workforce of Chad works in the agricultural sector, making it an extremely important aspect of their economy.  Before the oil project had begun in 2000, cotton was the chief export of Chad, accounting for nearly 90% of export income.  Cotton is still an important factor in their economy, but foreign investment from France, Germany and The Netherlands has made the oil industry more lucrative for Chad in recent years.</string>
		<key>climate</key>
		<string>Since Chad is a landlocked country in the heart of Africa, water is already scarce for many of its citizens and the effects of global warming and climate change have only made these problems worse.  The increasing temperatures, particularly near the Sahara Desert, are destroying the farm land and having a negative effect on their agricultural industry.  This has propmted Chad to undergo research in order to better understand and possibly control the effects of climate change and global warming</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>In the future, Chad looks to expand its traditional agricultural industry, as well as newer industries, such as its multi-billion dollar oil industry projects.  This will continue to be beneficial for Chad, as it already has been so far.  Chad understands that oil is a fuel of the past as well, and that in order to flourish in the future, they must discover new forms of fuel.  This has propelled Chad to undergo research into other forms of renewable energy, such as wind, solar and hydroelectric</string>

		<string>The Central African Republic is a landlocked country in Central Africa. It is bordered byChad to the north, Sudan to the northeast, South Sudan to the east, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo to the south and Cameroon to the west. The CAR covers a land area of about 620,000 square kilometres (240,000 sq mi) and had an estimated population of around 4.7 million as of 2014.
Most of the CAR consists of Sudano-Guinean savannas, but the country also includes a Sahelo-Sudanian zone in the north and an equatorial forest zone in the south. Two thirds of the country is within the Ubangi River basin (which flows into the Congo), while the remaining third lies in the basin of the Chari, which flows into Lake Chad.
What is today the Central African Republic has been inhabited for millennia; however, the country&apos;s current borders were established by France, which ruled the country as a colony starting in the late 19th century. After gaining independence from France in 1960, the Central African Republic was ruled by a series of autocratic leaders; by the 1990s, calls for democracy led to the first multi-party democratic elections in 1993. Ange-Félix Patassé became president, but was later removed by General François Bozizé in the 2003 coup. The Central African Republic Bush War began in 2004 and, despite a peace treaty in 2007 and another in 2011, fighting broke out between government, Muslim, and Christian factions in December 2012, leading to ethnic and religious cleansing and massive population displacement in 2013 and 2014.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>Sangho is the national language in the Central African Republic, and is spoken by the majority of inhabitants. Only a very small percentage have any understanding of French, even though it is the official language. The Central African Republic has over 80 different ethnic groups, and each of them has a different language.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Agriculture is a key industry for the CAR&apos;s economy, with the cultivation of cassava, peanuts, maize, millet, sorghum, sesame and plantains. The production of food crops is considerably higher than that of cash crops. Although the country has a very low per capita income, this figure does not take into account the unacknowledged sales of alcohol, diamonds, traditional medicine, ivory and bushmeat. Thus, this informal economy is more productive and important than the formal one. Ecotourism is an area of possible future expansion, due to the country&apos;s many wilderness regions. The country also has national parks and is renowned for its large numbers of forest elephants, which attract visitors. The Central African Republic is a member of the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa. The Central African Republic has been named one of the world&apos;s leading countries for sustainable development.</string>

The Croats arrived in the area of present-day Croatia during the early part of the 7th century AD. They organised the state into two duchies by the 9th century. Tomislav became the first king by 925, elevating Croatia to the status of a kingdom. The Kingdom of Croatia retained its sovereignty for nearly two centuries, reaching its peak during the rule of Kings Peter Krešimir IV and Dmitar Zvonimir. Croatia entered a personal union with Hungary in 1102. In 1527, faced with Ottoman conquest, the Croatian Parliament elected Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg to the Croatian throne. In 1918, after World War I, Croatia was included in the unrecognised State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs which seceded from Austria-Hungary and merged into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. A fascist Croatian puppet state existed during World War II. After the war, Croatia became a founding member and a federal constituent of Second Yugoslavia, a constitutionally socialist state. In June 1991, Croatia declared independence, which came into effect on 8 October of the same year.

Prague, the capital, is the largest city, with 1.3 million residents. The Czech Republic includes the historical territories of Bohemia and Moravia, andCzech Silesia.
The Czech state was formed in the late 9th century as the Duchy of Bohemia under the Great Moravian Empire. After the fall of the Empire in 907, the centre of power transferred from Moravia to Bohemia under thePřemyslids. In 1004, the duchy was formally recognized as part of the Holy Roman Empire,becoming the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1212, and reaching its greatest territorial extent in the 14th century. The King of Bohemia ruled not only Bohemia itself, but also other lands, which together formed the so-called Crown of Bohemia, and he had a vote in the election of the Holy Roman Emperor. In the Hussite wars of the 15th century driven by the Bohemian Reformation, the kingdom faced economic embargoes and defeated five crusades proclaimed by the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church and organized mainly by the emperor and princes of the Holy Roman Empire.
Following the Battle of Mohács in 1526, the whole Crown of Bohemia was gradually integrated into the Habsburg Monarchy alongside the Archduchy of Austria and the Kingdom of Hungary. The Bohemian Revolt (1618–20) against the Catholic Habsburgs led to the Thirty Years&apos; War, after which the monarchy consolidated its rule, reimposed Catholicism, and adopted a policy of gradual Germanization. With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the Bohemian Kingdom became part of the Austrian Empire. In the 19th century, the Czech lands became the industrial powerhouse of the monarchy and were subsequently the core of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, which was formed in 1918 following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after World War I.</string>

The island of Cuba was inhabited by numerous Amerindian tribes prior to the landing of explorer Christopher Columbus in 1492, who claimed it for the Kingdom of Spain. Cuba remained a colony of Spain until the Spanish–American War of 1898, after which it gained nominal independence as a de facto U.S. protectorate in 1902. The fragile republic endured increasingly radical politics and social strife, and despite efforts to strengthen its democratic system, Cuba came under the dictatorship of former president Fulgencio Batista in 1952.Growing unrest and instability led to Batista&apos;s ousting in January 1959 by the July 26 movement, which afterwards established a government under the leadership of Fidel Castro.

		<string>The Cayman Islands remained largely uninhabited until the 17th century. While there is no archaeological evidence for an indigenous people on the islands, a variety of settlers from various backgrounds made their home on the islands, including pirates, refugees from the Spanish Inquisition, shipwrecked sailors, and deserters from Oliver Cromwell&apos;s army in Jamaica.
The first recorded permanent inhabitant of the Cayman Islands, Isaac Bodden, was born on Grand Cayman around 1661. He was the grandson of the original settler named Bodden who was probably one of Oliver Cromwell&apos;s soldiers at the taking of Jamaica in 1655.
England took formal control of the Cayman Islands, along with Jamaica, as a result of the Treaty of Madrid of 1670. Following several unsuccessful attempts at settlement, a permanent English-speaking population in the islands dates from the 1730s. With settlement, after the first royal land grant by the Governor of Jamaica in 1734, came the perceived need for slaves. Many were brought to the islands from Africa; this is evident today with the majority of native Caymanians being of African and English descent. The results of the first census taken in the islands in 1802 showed the population on Grand Cayman to be 933 with 545 of those inhabitants being enslaved. Slavery was abolished in the Cayman Islands in 1833. At the time of abolition, there were over 950 enslaved Blacks of African ancestry enslaved by 116 white families of English ancestry.
The islands continued to be governed as part of the Colony of Jamaica until 1962, when they became a separate Crown colony while Jamaica became an independent Commonwealth realm.￼
The Cayman Islands historically have been a tax-exempt destination. On 8 February 1794, the Caymanians rescued the crews of a group of ten merchant ships, including HMS Convert, an incident that has since become known as the Wreck of the Ten Sail. The ships had struck a reef and run aground during rough seas. Legend has it that King George III rewarded the island with a promise never to introduce taxes as compensation for their generosity, as one of the ships carried a member of the King&apos;s own family. While this remains a popular legend, the story is not true.
However, whatever the history, in practice the government of the Cayman Islands has always relied on indirect and not direct taxes. The islands have never levied income tax, capital gains tax, or any wealth tax, making them a popular tax haven.
On 11–12 September 2004 the island of Grand Cayman, which lies largely unprotected at sea level, was hit by Hurricane Ivan, creating an 8-ft storm surge which flooded many areas of Grand Cayman. An estimated 83% of the dwellings on the island were damaged including 4% requiring complete reconstruction. A reported 70% of all dwellings suffered severe damage from flooding or wind. Another 26% sustained minor damage from partial roof removal, low levels of flooding, or impact with floating or wind driven hurricane debris. Power, water and communications were disrupted for months in some areas, as Ivan was the worst hurricane to hit the islands in 86 years.Grand Cayman began a major rebuilding process and within two years, its infrastructure was nearly returned to pre-hurricane status. Due to the tropical location of the islands, more hurricane or tropical systems have affected the Cayman Islands than any other region in the Atlantic basin; it has been brushed or directly hit, on average, every 2.23 years.</string>

During the 9th to 11th centuries, the Vikings sailed around Western Europe invading and plundering. The country was Christianised in the 10th century by Harald Blaatand and Saint Ansgar.

Canute the Great reigned in the early 11th century and united Denmark, Norway and England; after his death civil war ensued until Waldemar I in 1157.

In 1282 a Parliament and Council of Nobles was established after the signing of  the Great Charter. Later, in 1397, Margrethe I united Norway, Sweden and Denmark. However, by 1523, Sweden gained independence.

At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Norway lost to Sweden and Denmark regretted its support of Napoleon. In the early twentieth century, when World War I broke out, Denmark remained neutral. However, in 1940 it was invaded by Germany, when King Christian X advised his population to accept the occupation. Denmark was the only country occupied during WWII that saved all of its Jewish residents by smuggling them out of the country.

In 1944, Iceland gained independence from Denmark, having been a Danish territory since 1380. In 1948, the Faroe Islands were also granted independence. In 1953, Greenland became a territory of Denmark.

		<string>Cambodia, officially The Kingdom of Cambodia is a country in South East Asia.  Cambodia is the successor state of the once powerful Hindu and Buddhist Khmer Empire which ruled most of the Indochinese Peninsula between the 11th and 14th centuries.  Cambodia borders Thailand to its west and northwest, Laos to its northeast and Vietnam to its east and southeast. In the south it faces the Gulf of Thailand.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Income and GDP are both rapidly increasing in Cambodia, most rural households depend on agriculture and its related sub-sectors. Rice, fish, timber, garments and rubber are Cambodia&apos;s major exports.  Cambodia is one of the leading rice exporters in the world and claim they have over 1000 different varieties of rice.  The effects of global warming and climate change are creating problems for the agricultural industry however, which has prompted Cambodia to begin research on renewable forms of energy, such as wind, solar and hydroelectric.</string>
		<key>transportation</key>
		<string>Recently, there has been much emphasis on tourism and transportation needs.  Cambodia has been upgrading the main highways to international standards and most are vastly improved from 2006. Most main roads are now paved. Cambodia has two rail lines, totaling about 612 kilometers of track.  The lines run from the capital to Sihanoukville on the southern coast, and from Phnom Penh to Sisophon.  This has been done in an effort to increase the flow of tourists in and out of Cambodia, in order to increase their tourism industry.</string>

		<string>Djibouti, officially the Republic of Djibouti, is a country in the Horn of Africa. It is bordered by Eritrea in the north, Ethiopia in the west and south, and Somalia in the southeast. The remainder of the border is formed by the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.</string>
		<key>development</key>
		<string>The nation of Djibouti has a wealth of natural resources, as well as a growing industry and agriculture sector.  The economy of Djibouti is based on service activities connected with the country&apos;s strategic location and status as a free trade zone in northeast Africa. Two-thirds of the inhabitants live in the capital city, the remainder being mostly nomadic herders.  The nation also has newly created a tourism industry that is funded mostly by government programs and also by direct foreign investment.</string>
		<key>culture</key>
		<string>Djibouti has a very unique and old culture that relates mostly to that of the Arab world.  Among nomads, many wear a loosely wrapped white cotton robe called a tobe that goes down to about the knee, with the end thrown over the shoulder.  Women typically wear the dirac, which is a long, light, diaphanous voile dress made of cotton or polyester that is worn over a full-length half-slip and a brassiere. Married women tend to sport head-scarves referred to as shash, and also often cover their upper body with a shawl known as garbasaar. Unmarried or young women, however, do not always cover their heads. Traditional Arabian garb such as the male jellabiya and the female niqab is also commonly worn. For some occasions such as festivals, women may adorn themselves with specialized jewelry and head-dresses similar to those worn by the Berber tribes of the Maghreb.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>In the future, Djibouti will look to grow based on its agricultural strength and also its expand tourism industry.  Due to the success of government implemented economic reform policies, the tourism industry has been able to take off for Djibouti and has attracted immense foreign investment from countries such as France, England and the United States.  The opening of Djibouti Port has also attracted immense foreign investment and has further stimulated their economy. </string>

		<string>Dominica, officially the Commonwealth of Dominica, is an island nation in the Lesser Antilles region of the Caribbean Sea, south-southeast ofGuadeloupe and northwest of Martinique. Its size is 750 square kilometres (290 sq mi) and the highest point in the country is Morne Diablotins, which has an elevation of 1,447 metres (4,747 ft). The Commonwealth of Dominica had a population of 72,301 at the 2014 Census. The capital is Roseau which is located on the leeward side of the island.
Dominica was first discovered by the Spanish, then colonized by the French and British before finally obtaining independence in 1978. Dominica has been nicknamed the &quot;Nature Isle of the Caribbean for its unspoiled natural beauty. It is the youngest island in the Lesser Antilles, still being formed by geothermal-volcanic activity, as evidenced by the world&apos;s second-largest hot spring, Boiling Lake. The island features lush mountainous rainforests, home of many rare plant, animal, and bird species. There are xeric areas in some of the western coastal regions, but heavy rainfall occurs inland. The island has 365 rivers. The Sisserou parrot (also known as the imperial amazon), is found only on Dominica and is the island&apos;s national bird. It is featured on the national flag. Dominica&apos;s economy is heavily dependent on tourism and agriculture.
Christopher Columbus named the island after the day of the week on which he spotted it, a Sunday (dies Dominica in Latin), 3 November 1493. In the hundred years after Columbus&apos;s landing, Dominica remained isolated. At the time it was inhabited by the Island Caribs, or Kalinago people, and over time more settled there after being driven from surrounding islands, as European powers entered the region. The people of Spain left the island due to isolation and the fierce Island Carib warriors that inhabited the island at the moment. France had a colony for several years, importing African slaves to work on its plantations. In this period, the Antillean Creole language developed. France formally ceded possession of Dominica to Great Britain in 1763. Great Britain established a small colony on the island in 1805.
Britain abolished slavery throughout the British Empire in 1834. By 1838, Dominica became the first British Caribbean colony to have a legislature controlled by an ethnic African majority. In 1896, the United Kingdom took governmental control of Dominica, turning it into a Crown colony. Half a century later, from 1958 to 1962, Dominica became a province of the short-lived West Indies Federation. On 3 November 1978, Dominica became an independent nation.</string>

		<key>about</key>
		<string>The Dominican Republic is a nation on the island of Hispaniola, part of the Greater Antilles archipelago in the Caribbean region. The western three-eighths of the island is occupied by the nation of Haiti, making Hispaniola one of two Caribbean islands, along with Saint Martin, that are shared by two countries. Both by area and population, the Dominican Republic is the second-largest Caribbean nation (after Cuba), with 48,445 square kilometres (18,705 sq mi) and nearly 10 million people, one million of which live in the capital city, Santo Domingo.
Christopher Columbus landed on the island in 1492, which the Taíno people had inhabited since the 7th century. It became the site of the first permanent European settlement in the Americas; namely Santo Domingo, the oldest continuously inhabited city and the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the New World. After three centuries of Spanish rule, with French and Haitian interludes, the country became independent in 1821. The ruler,José Núñez de Cáceres, intended that the Dominican Republic be part of the nation of Gran Colombia, but he was quickly removed by the Haitian government and Dominican slave revolts. Victorious in the Dominican War of Independence against Haitian rule in 1844, the Dominican Republic over the next 72 years, experienced mostly internal strife and encountered a brief return to colonial status under Spanish rule proposed by general Pedro Santana, becoming the only nation in the hemisphere to do so after gaining its independence. The United States occupation lasted eight years between 1916–1924, and a subsequent calm and prosperous six-year period under Horacio Vásquez Lajara, were followed by the dictatorship of Rafael Leónidas Trujillo Molina until 1961. The civil war of 1965, the country&apos;s last, was ended by a U.S.-led intervention, and was followed by the authoritarian rule of Joaquín Balaguer, 1966–1978. Since then, the Dominican Republic has moved toward representative democracy,[5] and has been led by Leonel Fernández for most of the time after 1996. Danilo Medina, the Dominican Republic&apos;s current president, succeeded Fernández in 2012, winning 51% of the electoral vote over his opponent ex-president Hipólito Mejía.</string>

		<string>Egypt is a country mainly in North Africa, with the Sinai Peninsula forming a land bridge in Western Asia. Covering Egypt borders the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Red Sea to the east, Sudan to the south and Libya to the west.
Egypt is one of the most populous countries in Africa and the Middle East. The great majority of its estimated 76 million live near the banks of the Nile River, where the only arable agricultural land is found. The large areas of the Sahara Desert are sparsely inhabited. About half of Egypt&apos;s residents live in urban areas, with the majority spread across the densely-populated centers of greater Cairo, Alexandria and other major cities in the Nile Delta.
Egypt is famous for its ancient civilization and some of the world&apos;s most famous monuments, including the Giza pyramid complex and its Great Sphinx. The southern city of Luxor contains numerous ancient artifacts, such as the Karnack Temple and the Valley of the Kings. Egypt is widely regarded as an important political and cultural nation of the Middle East.</string>
		<key>climate</key>
		<string>Every year, a predictable flooding of the Nile replenishes Egypt&apos;s soil. This gives the country consistent harvest throughout the year. Many know this event as “The Gift of the Nile”.  The rise in sea levels due to global warming threatens Egypt&apos;s densely populated coastal strip and could have grave consequences for the country&apos;s economy, agriculture and industry. Combined with growing demographic pressures, a rise in sea levels could turn millions of Egyptians into environmental refugees by the end of the century, according to climate experts. This has prompted Egypt to take an aggressive stance against global warming.</string>
		<key>foreign relations</key>
		<string>The fact that Egypt is geographically a bridge between Africa and The Middle East, Egypt&apos;s foreign policy operates along moderate lines. Factors such as population size, historical events, military strength, diplomatic expertise and a strategic geographical position give Egypt extensive political influence in Africa and the Middle East. Cairo has been a crossroads of regional commerce and culture for centuries, and its intellectual and Islamic institutions are at the center of the region&apos;s social and cultural development. Egypt is considered to be an ally of the Western and European World and considered to be the dominant military power in the Middle East and Africa along with Israel.  Egypt&apos;s economy depends mainly on agriculture, media, petroleum exports, and tourism, there are also more than three million Egyptians working abroad, mainly in Saudi Arabia, the Persian Gulf and Europe. The completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1970 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the time-honored place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A rapidly-growing population, limited arable land, and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress the economy.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>In the upcoming years, Egypt will strive to keep their agricultural strength of the Nile River Delta, as well as focus on their booming economy to expand even more. They are considered to be one of the most advanced economies in the world right now in terms of Economic Reform.
Egypt has been the first Arab country to take an initiative in combating climate change, both with the United Nations support and European Union, through the Kyoto Protocol and other various conferences and agendas related to climate change. Due to the emphasis that climate change plays on Egypt’s agricultural Nile River Delta, they have been forced to act quicker than most countries, as they are in immediate danger. They have already begun to shift their technologies, industries and researchers towards new global warming solutions.

		<string>Tigrinya and Arabic are the two most widely spoken languages in Eritrea, however English and Italian are also understood by many of the population, from the former colonial period. There are many other languages spoken in Eritrea, of which most derive from the Afro-Asiatic language family. Other languages spoken include Tigre, Dahlik, Afar, Beja, Blin, Saho, Kunama and Nara.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>As in other countries in Africa, Eritrea&apos;s economy is mainly consisted of subsistence agriculture, accounting for around 80% of their produce. The Eritrean-Ethiopian War had a severely damaging effect on the country&apos;s economy. Despite this, Etritrea&apos;s infrastructure has been gradually improving, with the building of new roads and improving ports and bridges; most importantly the building of a new coastal motorway running for 500km across the country, as well as the improvement of the Eritrean Railway. Eritrea imports petroleum, and is currently looking for alternative, and more sustainable energy sources, such as wind, solar and hydropower.</string>
		<key>geography</key>
		<string>Located in the Horn of Africa, Eritrea borders the Red Sea to the east, and is bisected by one of the biggest mountain ranges in the world, the Great Rift Valley. The Dahlak Archipelago is situated just off the coast of the country. The Afar Triangle is a likely meeting point of three tectonic plates, and the highest mountain in the country is 9, 902 ft above sea level. The country historically had a large number of elephants, but now that number is only thought to be around 100. These elephants have, uniquely, developed a symbiotic relationship with olive baboons. In 2006, Eritrea was the first country in the world to declare its whole coast to be an environmentally protected zone.</string>
		<key>about</key>
		<string>Eritrea, officially the State of Eritrea,is a country in the Horn of Africa. With its capital at Asmara, it is bordered by Sudan in the west, Ethiopia in the south, and Djibouti in the southeast. The northeastern and eastern parts of Eritrea have an extensive coastline along the Red Sea, across from Saudi Arabia and Yemen. The nation has a total area of approximately 117,600 km2 (45,406 sq mi), and includes the Dahlak Archipelago and several of the Hanish Islands. Its name Eritrea is based on the Greek name for the Red Sea (Ἐρυθρὰ Θάλασσα Erythra Thalassa), which was first adopted for Italian Eritrea in 1890.
Eritrea is a multi-ethnic country, with nine recognized ethnic groups. It has a population of around six million inhabitants. Most residents speak Afroasiatic languages, either of the Semitic or Cushitic branches. Among these communities, the Tigrinya make up about 55% of the population, with the Tigre people constituting around 30% of inhabitants. In addition, there are a number of Nilo-Saharan-speaking Nilotic ethnic minorities. Most people in the territory adhere to Christianity or Islam.
The Kingdom of Aksum, covering much of modern-day Eritrea and northern Ethiopia, rose somewhere around the first or second centuries[9][10] and adopted Christianity around the time Islam had spread through Egypt and the Levant. In medieval times much of Eritrea fell under the Medri Bahri Kingdom, with a smaller region being part of the Hamasien Republic. The creation of modern day Eritrea is a result of the incorporation of independent Kingdoms and various vassal states of the Ethiopian empire and the Ottoman Empire, eventually resulting in the formation of Italian Eritrea. In 1947 Eritrea became part of a federation with Ethiopia, theFederation of Ethiopia and Eritrea. Subsequent annexation into Ethiopia led to the Eritrean War of Independence, ending with Eritrean independence following a referendum in April 1993. Hostilities between Eritrea and Ethiopia persisted, leading to the Eritrean–Ethiopian War of 1998–2000 and further skirmishes with both Djibouti and Ethiopia.</string>

		<string>The Territory of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, also called Cocos Islands and Keeling Islands, is a territory of Australia, located in the Indian Ocean, southwest of Christmas Island and approximately midway between Australia and Sri Lanka.
The territory consists of two atolls and 27 coral islands, of which two, West Island and Home Island, are inhabited with a total population of approximately 600.</string>
		<key>history</key>
		<string>In 1609, Captain William Keeling was the first European to see the islands, while serving in the East India Company,[3] but they remained uninhabited until the 19th century.

In 1814, a Scottish merchant seaman named Captain John Clunies-Ross stopped briefly at the islands on a trip to India, nailing up a Union Jack and planning to return and settle on the islands with his family in the future.[3]

However, a wealthy Englishman named Alexander Hare had similar plans, and hired a captain – coincidentally, Clunies-Ross&apos; brother – to bring him and a harem of forty Malay women to the islands, where he hoped to set up his own private residence.[3] Hare had previously served as governor of Maluka, a colony in Borneo and found that &quot;he could not confine himself to the tame life that prosy civilisation affords&quot;.[3]

When Clunies-Ross returned two years later with his wife, children and mother-in-law, and found Hare already established on the island and living with a private harem, a feud grew instantly between the two men.[3] Clunies-Ross&apos; eight sailors &quot;began at once the invasion of the new kingdom to take possession of it, women and all&quot;.[3][4]

After some time, Hare&apos;s women began deserting him, and instead finding themselves mates amongst Clunies-Ross&apos; sailors.[5] Disheartened, Hare left the island. He died in Bencoolen in 1834.[6]

Clunies-Ross&apos; workers were paid in a currency called the Cocos rupee, a currency John Clunies-Ross minted himself that could only be redeemed at the company store.[7]

On 1 April 1836, HMS Beagle under Captain Robert FitzRoy arrived to take soundings establishing the profile of the atoll as part of the survey expedition of the Beagle. To the young naturalist Charles Darwin, who was on the ship, the results supported a theory he had developed of how atolls formed, which he later published as The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs. He studied the natural history of the islands and collected specimens.[8] Darwin&apos;s assistant Syms Covington noted that &quot;an Englishman [he was in fact Scottish] and HIS family, with about sixty or seventy mulattos from the Cape of Good Hope, live on one of the islands. Captain Ross, the governor, is now absent at the Cape.&quot;</string>

Its easternmost region lies on the coast of the Gulf of Fonseca, opposite Nicaragua. As of 2013, El Salvador had a population of approximately 6.29 million making it the most densely populated country in the region composed predominantly by Mestizos of European and Indigenous American descent.
Present-day El Salvador was inhabited by numerous sophisticated Mesoamerican nations, predominantly the Cuzcatlecs but also the Lenca and Maya prior to the European exploration and subsequent colonization of the Americas. By 1525 the Spanish Empire had conquered the territory, incorporating it into the colony of New Spain up until 1821, when it achieved independence as part of the Federal Republic of Central America. Upon the republic&apos;s dissolution in 1841, El Salvador became sovereign until forming a short-lived union with Honduras and Nicaragua called the Greater Republic of Central America, which lasted from 1895 to 1898.
From the late 19th to mid 20th century, El Salvador endured chronic political and economic instability characterized by coups, revolts, and a succession of authoritarian rulers. Persistent socioeconomic inequality and civil unrest culminated in the devastating Salvadoran Civil War (1979–1992), which was fought between the military-led government and a coalition of left-wing guerrilla groups. The conflict ended with a negotiated settlement that established a multiparty constitutional republic, which remains in place to this day.</string>

		<string>Finland, officially the Republic of Finland,is a Nordic country in Northern Europe bordered by Sweden to the west, Norway to the north and Russiato the east; Estonia lies to the south across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is part of the collective geographical group of nations Fennoscandia.
In 2013, Finland&apos;s population was around 5.5 million, with the majority living in its southern regions.In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union. Finland is a parliamentary republic with a central government based in the capital Helsinki, local governments in 336 municipalities[9][10] and an autonomous region, the Åland Islands. Over 1.4 million people live in the Greater Helsinki metropolitan area, which produces a third of the country&apos;s GDP. Other large cities include Tampere, Turku, Oulu, Jyväskylä, Lahti, and Kuopio.
From the late 12th century until 1809, Finland was part of Sweden, a legacy reflected in the prevalence of the Swedish language and its official status. It was then incorporated into the Russian Empire as the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland, until the Russian Revolution of 1917 prompted the Finnish Declaration of Independence. This was followed by the Finnish Civil War in which the pro-Bolshevik Finnish Socialist Workers&apos; Republic was defeated by the pro-conservative &quot;Whites&quot; with support from the German Empire. After a brief attempt to establish a kingdom, the country became a republic. In World War II, Finnish forces fought in three separate conflicts: the Winter War (1939–1940) and Continuation War (1941–1944) against the Soviet Union and the Lapland War (1944–1945) against Nazi Germany. Finland joined the United Nations in 1955 and established an official policy of neutrality. It joined the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 1969, the European Union in 1995, and the Eurozone at its inception in 1999.</string>

		<string>A very high percentage of the population speak the Finnish language as their first language. Finnish is an Uralic language, similar in construction to Estonian, although the two are not mutually intelligible. The second official language is Swedish, and other minority languages spoken are Russian, Estonian, Finnish Romani, as well as the three Sami languages, Northern Sami, Inari Sami and Skolt Sami.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Finland&apos;s is an industrialised, free-market economy, with a relatively high GDP. The country is well integrated into the EU, with EU trade making a large proportion of its income, and it is notable for currently being the only Nordic country to have taken the Euro as its currency, and hence to have joined the Eurozone. Finland has been ranked as the second most stable country in the world.

Industry and public services are the most important economic sectors. Agricultural produce in Finland includes barley, wheat, sugar, beets, potatoes, fish and dairy. The country&apos;s main industries are metals, machinery, electronics, shipbuilding, pulp and paper products, chemicals, textiles and clothing. Finland&apos;s main natural resources are timber, iron ore, copper, zinc, lead, nickel, gold, silver and limestone, and its trading partners are Sweden, UK, Russia, Germany, China, Netherlands, Denmark and the US.</string>

		<string>France has one of the largest economies in the world, as indicated by its GDP. It is a member of G8, the EU and OECD, and is a high globally ranking exporter and importer of goods. Because of its combination of extensive stretches of fertile land and modernised technology, France is a leading exporter of agricultural produce, and as well as this it produces significantly less CO2 than other countries because of its investment in nuclear power. Since the end of World War II, France and Germany have become politically and economically very close, and are considered to be the two core countries of the EU, who are pushing for greater integration between EU member states</string>
		<key>history</key>
		<string>In the first century BC, Roman emperor Julius Caesar conquered the ancient country of Gaul, whose borders roughly correlate with France&apos;s. The Gauls adopted the Roman language of Latin, from which French later evolved, as well as its culture and religion - Christianity first appeared in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. In 4AD, Gaul&apos;s frontier along the Rhine was overrun by Germanic tribes (called the Franks, from which came Francie). In 843 Charlemagne&apos;s Carolingian Empire divided into Western Francia, East Francia and Middle Francia; Western Francia was the precursor to modern France. In 987 Hugh Capet was crowned King of France, and his descendants, from the House of Valois, House of Bourbon and direct Capetians, unified the country through a series of wars. The monarchy was at its height in the 17th century, under the reign of Louis XIV. At that time, the country had the largest population in Europe and had great importance and influence over European politics and culture. It was in France that the Englightenment housed many of its key intellectual thinkers, and in the 18th century great scientific discoveries were made by French scientists.

The Monarchy ruled until the French Revolution of 1789, in which Louis XVI and his wife, Marie Antoinette were executed, along with thousands of French citizens. In 1799, Napoleon Bonaparte made himself First Consul and Emperor of the newly forged French Republic. During the First Empire, Bonaparte&apos;s armies conquered most of continental Europe, upto his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Bonaparte&apos;s descendants led after him, until 1870 in the Franco-Prussian war, when Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte was deafeated, and his regime replaced by the Third Empire.

France played a key role in the two World Wars of the 20th Century. After World War II, the Fourth Republic was established; however, France struggled to keep its status as important nation state, with struggles over territory in Algeria and the First Indochina War. In 1958, the unstable Fourth Republic gave way to form the Fifth Republic, with Charles de Gaulle as president. The Algerian War was ended in 1962 with peace negotiations which resulted in Algerian Indepedence.

In recent years, France&apos;s political cooperation with Germany has formed a stronghold of the European Union, leading to the foundation of the Euro in 1999, now adopted by many EU member states. The French Republic is now a semi-presidential republic with strong democratic ties, with parliament made up of the National Assembly and a Senate.</string>
		<key>culture</key>
		<string>The French language is a Romance language spoken globally by 90 million as their first language, and 190 million as second language. Like Portuguese, Spanish, Italian and Romanion, French is a descendant of the Latin of the Roman Empire. In France, there are a variety of dialects and regional languages. French is written using the 26 langugaes of the Latin alphabet, plus five diacritics (the circumflex accent, acute accent, grave accent, diaeresis and cedilla).</string>

		<string>Romania is a country located in South-East Central Europe, North of the Balkan Peninsula, on the Lower Danube, within and outside the Carpathian arch, bordering on the Black Sea. Almost all of the Danube Delta is located within its territory. It shares a border with Hungary and Serbia to the west, Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova to the northeast, and Bulgaria to the south.

The territory&apos;s recorded history includes periods of rule by Dacians, the Roman Empire, the Kingdom of Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire. As a nation-state, the country was formed by the merging of Moldavia and Wallachia in 1859 and it gained recognition of its independence in 1878. Later, in 1918, they were joined by Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia. At the end of World War II, parts of its territories were occupied by the USSR and Romania became a member of the Warsaw Pact. With the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989, Romania started a series of political and economic reforms. After a decade of post-independence economic problems, Romania made economic reforms such as low flat tax rates in 2005 and joined the European Union in January 1, 2007. While Romania&apos;s income level remains one of the lowest in the European Union, reforms have increased the growth speed. Romania is now an upper-middle income country economy. Romania has the 9th largest territory and the 7th largest population among the European Union member states. Its capital and largest city is Bucharest the 6th largest city in the EU with 1.9 million people.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Romania is considered to be an upper middle income economy with a GDP of around 264 billion dollars. Since the decline of Communism in Romania in 1989, at first the economy was weak, but since 2000, due to periods of decreasing unemployment, decreasing inflation and high growth, the Romanian economy has been able to expand and on January 1st 2007, they became a member of the European Union. Also Romania has an extremely low debt rate as compared to other large European countries, which is another contributing factor to their success. Furthermore, Romania has an incredible trade surplus, Romania&apos;s main exports are clothing and textiles, industrial machinery, electrical and electronic equipment, metallurgic products, raw materials, cars, military equipment, software, pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, and agricultural products (fruits, vegetables, and flowers). Generally Romania tades mostly with members of the European Union, mainly Germany and Italy.
Also, Romania has changed from a progressive tax rate, to a flat tax rate, which has allowed them to have tremendous gains, expecially in the private sector. This tax plan also encourages business and growth, nearly 25% of all employees in Romania work in the agricultural industry as well. This makes Romania one of the largest agricultural prodeucers in Europe. Romania has been attracting tremendous amounts of foreign investment since 2000 and has been considered the world&apos;s second fastest economic reforme</string>

		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>Since 1998, Romania has worked to strengthen their relations with the West, especially the United States and European Union members. Currently Romania is a member of NATO, the World Trade Organization, the World Bank, European Union and International Monetary Fund. Aside with strengthening relations with the West, Romania also seeks to strengthen its relations with the Eastern European former Soviet Block and particularly Hungary and Moldova, because of their similar language and culture. In the years to come, Romania will seek to capitalize on the strength of its growing economy and its natural resource wealth and abundance.
The government of Romania has adopted many policies to combat and research climate change, with special interest in limiting greenhouse gas emissions. Romania has taken initiative, creating the infrastructure as well as supplying the education necessary to implement the changes they wish to make. Some of the policies that Romania has created are promoting energy production and natural resources, energy efficiency and landfill allocations.</string>

		<string>Gabon, officially the Gabonese Republic (French: République gabonaise), is a sovereign state on the west coast of Central Africa. Located on the equator, Gabon is bordered by Equatorial Guinea to the northwest, Cameroon to the north, the Republic of the Congo on the east and south, and the Gulf of Guinea to the west. It has an area of nearly 270,000 square kilometres (100,000 sq mi) and its population is estimated at 1.5 million people. Its capital and largest city is Libreville.
Since its independence from France in 1960, Gabon has had three presidents. In the early 1990s, Gabon introduced a multi-party system and a new democratic constitution that allowed for a more transparent electoral process and reformed many governmental institutions. Gabon was also a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the 2010–2011 term.
Low population density, abundant petroleum, and foreign private investment have helped make Gabon one of the most prosperous countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, with the 4th highest HDI[3] and the third highest GDP per capita (PPP) (after Equatorial Guinea and Botswana) in the region.</string>
		<key>languages</key>

		<string>Gabon has a relatively prosperous economy in comparison with other African nations. Its workforce is mostly employed in the industry sector, followed by services then agriculture. Its economy is now based upon the oil sector, since oil was discovered there in the 1970s, before that it was reliant upon timber, uranium and manganese. Other industries include food and beverage, textiles, cement, gold mining and ship repair. Its agricultural produce includes sugar, cocoa, coffee, cattle, palm oil and fish. Despite the country&apos;s oil revenues giving it a relatively high income per capita, the country has bad debt problems and a bad report with the World Bank and IMF for its debt management. There has been some progress in the privatisation of industries, as well as administrative reform, but the economy continues to struggle.</string>
		<key>culture</key>
		<string>Gabonese music includes a variety of folk styles, while imported rock and pop music from the UK and US is popular.

		<string>The Gambia, officially the Republic of The Gambia is commonly known as Gambia, is a country in Western Africa. The Gambia is the smallest country on mainland Africa, bordered to the north, east, and south by Senegal, and has a small coast on the Atlantic Ocean in the west. Its borders roughly correspond to the path of the Gambia River, the nation&apos;s namesake, which flows through the country&apos;s center and empties into the Atlantic Ocean.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Gambia has an extremely productive labor force based upon its agricultural industry, with their main export being peanuts.  They have success in their export business due to the vast port system they have created for themselves.  The country also has an extensive tourism industry that they have created and built from the ground up for themselves</string>
		<key>agriculture</key>
		<string>The main exports of Gambia are peanuts, soft drinks, soap and clothing.  Agricultural industry is still a dominant force in the country however, nearly 60% of the GDP of the nation comes from their agricultural industry and over 70% of the workforce works in the agricultural industry.  In the past the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe have mainly been Gambia&apos;s chief trading countries, relying heavily on the exports from Gambia.  Now though, Japan, U.S.A. and Senegal have joined the ranks and have become chief importers.  Gambia also trades heavily with Germany, The Ivory Coast and Netherlands as well.</string>
		<key>climate</key>
		<string>Like so many of the African nations, the natural resources of Gambia are being threatened by increasing global temperatures and drastic climate change.  With so many of the African nations being with proximity to the equator, climate change, specifically increasing temperatures can have a drastic effect on their health and safety.

		<string>Georgia is a transcontinental country in the South Caucasus region of Southwest Asia, bordered by the Russian Federation to the north, Azerbaijan to the east, Armenia to the south, and Turkey to the southwest.  The history of Georgia can be traced back to the ancient kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia, and it was one of the first countries to adopt Christianity as an official religion early in the 4th century. At the beginning of the 19th century Georgia became a part of the Russian Empire. After a brief period of independence following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Georgia was forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1922, but independence was restored in 1991.</string>
		<key>education</key>
		<string>The education system of Georgia has undergone sweeping modernizing reforms since 2004.The adult literacy rate in Georgia is apparently 100%, this is extremely high, as education in Georgia is mandatory for all children aged 6-14.  The school system is divided into elementary (6 years; age level 6-12), basic (3 years; age level 12-15), and secondary (2 years; age level 15-17), or alternatively vocational studies (2 years). Students with a secondary school certificate have access to higher education. Only the students who have passed the Unified National Examinations may enroll in a state-accredited higher education institution, based on ranking of scores he/she received at the exams. Most of these institutions offer three level studies: a Bachelor&apos;s Programme (3-4 years); a Master&apos;s Programme (2 years), and a Doctoral Programme (3 years). There is also a Certified Specialist&apos;s Programme that represents a single-level higher education programme lasting for 3-6 years.  Georgia is seeking to be an eduation leader throughout Europe.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Archaeological research demonstrates that Georgia has been involved in commerce with many lands and empires since the ancient times, largely due its location on the Black Sea and later on the historical Silk Road. Gold, silver, copper and iron have been mined in the Caucasus Mountains, furthermore the ancient tradition of wine making is still extremely prevelant today.  Throughout Georgia&apos;s modern history agriculture and tourism have been principal economic sectors, due to the country&apos;s climate and topography.
For much of the 20th century, Georgia&apos;s economy was within the Soviet model of command economy.  Since the fall of the USSR in 1991, Georgia embarked on a major structural reform designed to transition to a free market economy. However, as with all other post-Soviet states, Georgia faced a severe fear of economic collapse, but they would previal and become an extremely important member of the European Business community.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>Georgia will continue to grow economically out of the shadow of its Soviet days, and in doing so reform its government and policies.  It will build on its strengths, such as education and an extremely high literacy rate, and also strengthen weaknesses such as lack of exports and finshed goods.  Georgia will also join the rest of Europe in research and studies for the policies and solutions in regard to climate change and global warming.</string>

		<key>about</key>
		<string>In 800, Charlemagne divided his Carolingian Empire, and the eastern portion became the Holy Roman Empire (otherwise known as the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation). The German king was crowned Holy Roman Emperor of these regions in 962, with German princes increasing their influence further south and east. The edict of the Golden Bull in 1356 provided the basic constitution of the empire, that lasted until its dissolution.

In 1517, Martin Luther pinned his 95 Theses to Wittenberg&apos;s church door, undermining the Catholic church and starting the Reformation - afterwhich many German states took up the separate religion of German Lutheranism. From 1740, the split between the Austrian Hapsburg monarchy and the Kingdom of Prussia dominated German history. After Napoleon&apos;s downfall, a league of 39 states was formed, and, in line with the revolutions which had successfuly created a republic in France, intellectuals started the 1848 Revolutions of the German states. Otto von Bismarck was elected prime minister, and consequently waged war on Denmark and won the Austro-Prussian war, then excluding Austria from the subsequent affairs of German states.

Germany was unified in 1871, when the German Empire was formed. From 1884, Germany started establishing colonies in non-European countries, leading to the race to claim African lands under the rule of William II. This imperialistic bent caused friction with other world powers, with Germany becoming increasingly isolated. The assassination of Austria&apos;s crown prince in 1914 started World War I, in which Germany, as part of the Central Powers, suffered defeat and was consequently forced to sign the Treaty of Versailles. In 1918 German Revolution broke out, and Emperor William II abdicated. The Weimar Republic was formed, under which the German Workers Party, later known as the Nazi party was formed. Suffering under both the Great Depression, and the harsh conditions of the Treaty of Versailles, the German public became increasingly disenchanted with their democratic government. Pushed by right-wing advisors, in 1933, Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany.

Under the Third Reich, Germany became a single-party totalitarian state. In 1939, Germany launched a blitzkrieg against Poland, which prompted the start of the Second World War. Germany gained control over much of Europe, and in 1941 invaded the Soviet Union and then declared war on the US. The storming of the beaches at Normandy by the Allies on D-Day marked a turning point, following which the German armies retreated and eventually surrendered in 1945. In what was latterly called The Holocaust, the Third Reich regime subjugated many parts of society, for example Jews, homosexuals, communists, Roma and priests. World War II and Nazi genocide caused 35 million dead in Europe.

After their defeat, Germany was partitioned into four military occupation zones. The Western two zones were controlled by the UK, US and France, and were merged to form Western Germany, or the Federal Republic of Germany, with Bonn as its capital. The Eastern zones were merged to form East Germany, or the German Democratic Republic, taking East Berlin as its capital. West Germany acted under a social market economy, and was aligned with the UK, US and France. It was a founding member of the EEC in 1958. Meanwhile, East Germany was under the Eastern bloc, with political power in the hands of the politburo, and enforced by the Stasi secret service. Ironically, although East German propaganda told of the limited freedoms and danger of invasion from West Germany, its people often looked to West Germany for political freedoms and economic wealth. The Berlin Wall, built in 1961to prevent East Germans defecting to the West, became a symbol for the Cold War. Political demonstrations in 1989 led to the Fall of the Berlin Wall, and increased freedoms of borders, and in 1990 German reunification took place.</string>

		<string>Germany, and its close ally spain, make up a central core of the EU member states, which is concerned with looking for sustainable future alternatives for energy supply, in order to minimise man&apos;s negative impact on the environment. Unlike other countries, almost all Germans acknowledge that it is manmade causes which lead to climate change, and so the country is extremely environmentally conscious. The country is dedicated to the Kyoto protocol, and tries to limit CO2 production through such measures as recycling, renewable enrgy sources, biodiversity, sustainable development and low emission standards. However, despite this, Germany produces significant amounts of CO2 through coal-burning, and this is leading to acid rain and the deterioration of forests. Additionally, Germany&apos;s glaciers in its alpine regions are melting, and climate change is showing its effects through natural effects such as flooding and storms. Germany is currently working to meet EU directive on Flora, Fauna and Habitat. Germany is the leading producer of renewable energy sources wind power and solar power technology in the world.</string>

		<string>Tourism
Germany has a thriving tourism industry. It is the seventh most visited country in the world, and has a great sense of tradition, with the history of its cities and beautiful pastoral landscapes. Key tourist towns include Berlin, Heidelberg, Munich, Tubingen, Schwangau and Dresden.
Language
German is the official language, and one of the 23 languages of the European Union. It is closely related to English, Dutch and Frisian languages, and uses the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet, as well as three vowels with umlauts. There are various German dialects, tracing back to the different German tribes, and many of them are unrecognisable to people who speak only standard German because of their differences in lexicon, phonology and syntax.
Literature
There are many great German writers, including Goethe, Schiller, Mann, Brecht, Hesse, Grass, as well as philosophers such as Hegel, Marx, Engels, Nietzsche, Shopenhauer, Heidegger and Kant.
Music
Germany was the centre of European Classical music from the 17th to the 19th centuries. J.S. Bach was composing between 1680 and 1720, and was followed by Handel, Beethoven and then Romantic composers Brahms, Schubert, Schumann, Bruch, Mendelssohn and Wagner. In the 20th Century, the Second Viennese School formed around serialist composers Schoenberg, Berg and Webern, and led the way for such innovators as Stockhausen. In popular music, Germany has a varied mixture of folk, dance and pop, and hosts annually the Love Parade Festival. Krautrock pioneers such as Kraftwerk hail from Germany.
Art
As with music and architecture - for example in the pioneer of Modernist architecture Walter Gropius who wrote his Bauhaus Manifesto in the 1920 and invented the skyscraper - Germany has hosted many important art movements. Holbein, Grunewald and Durer were some of the earliest artistic geniuses from Germany, and were followed by such painters as the Romanticist Caspar David Friedrich and Surrealist Max Ernst.
Cinema
German cinema is another thriving tradition, starting with Fritz Lang and his Metropolis and going on to the New German Cinema directors in the 70s and 80s such as Wim Wenders and Werner Herzog. The Berlin Film Festival is one of the world&apos;s chief annual film festivals, and the European Film Festival is held every second year in Berlin.
Sport
Sport is a major part of German life, with association football the most popular sport in the country. The German football team won the World Cup in 1954, 1974 and 1990, and Germany has hosted the cup on various occasions. Renowned footballers include Beckenbauer, Muller, Klinsmann and Kahn. Other prominent spectator sports include ice hockey, handball and tennis. Germany is one of the leading motorsports countries in the world, with Michael Schumacher the most successful Formula One driver in history. Equally, German Olympians have always fared well, and Germany has hosted the games twice.</string>

City-states spread across the Greek peninsula and simultaneously there was a cultural boom in architecture, drama, science and philosophy, its centre in the democratic city of Athens. Alexander the Great ushered in the Greek Hellenistic Era, which is seen as a bridge - in some ways a decline - from the highpoints of the preceding Greek Classical Era and the following emergence of the Roman Empire. It featured a wave of colonisation across much of Europe and Asia.

With Roman rule over Greek lands from 146 BC came the merging of Hellenic and Roman cultures (for example, many of the Roman myths are merely transposed from their preceding Greek counterparts, with different names for the deities and heroes). This mergure created the Byzantine Empire, centred on Constantinople which remained a cultural and political centre until its defeat at the hands of the Ottomans in 1453. On the cross-over to the Ottoman Era, many vanguards of the Greek intelligentsia migrated to Western Europe and were great contributors to the Renaissance, by transferring the works of Ancient Greece to Europe.

The Greeks won in their War of Independence against the Ottomans in 1821, and following this there was dispute over the leader of the country - with monarchs from countries such as Denmark and Bavaria stepping in, however Trikopuis, a key political figure, curbed the power of the monarchy and gave many rights of rule to the prime minister. As a result of the Balkan Wars, Greece extended its territory, and after World War I came the fraught and bitter population exchange between Turkey and Greece - with Turks expelled from communes in Greece and vice versa. The Greco-Italian war gave Allies their first victory of the Second World War, with Greeks refusing to surrender to fascist Italian control.

After liberation, Greece underwent a civil war between royalists and communists, leading to desperate economic tensions. The following 20 years were characterised by the marginalisation of the leftists, but also significant economic growth. In 1975 the monarchy was abolished and a democratic republic founded, and in 1981 Greece became the tenth member state of the EU.</string>

		<string>Tourism
Tourism is Greece&apos;s key industry, with over 16 million people visiting the country each year. It is popular for its long and varied history, showcased in historical cities such as Athens and Thessaloniki, and for the chance to see ancient relics such as the Parthenon and the remains of the town of Pompeii. It also attracts many tourists for its beach and coastal resorts, specifically on the many islands belonging to the country, such as Crete and Corfu.
Languages
Greek is the official language of the country, with almost the whole population using it as their first language. Some minority languages are spoken by people in different geographic regions of the country, for example the Arvanites, an Alanian-speaking group located in rural areas around Athens. In northern Greece, there are some Slavic-speaking groups whose dialects can be classified as Macedonian or Bulgarian. Greece&apos;s Jewish community originally spoke Ladino, but is today only spoken by a few thousand people. Many Greek speakers use the distinct dialect Pontic.
Literature
Western philosophy was born in Greece, with Socrates, Aristotle and Plato hugely influential forces, whose relevance is still felt today. As well as these three key thinkers, were many Greek schools of philosophy such as Epicureanism, Stoicism and Skepticism. The most famous and enduring works of Greek literature are Homer&apos;s Iliad and Odyssey, chronicling the Trojan Wars and the consequent trials of Odysseus as he tried to get back to his home island of Ithaca. Important poets included Hesiod, Sappho and Pindar and after them the Roman historian Plutarch was a vital figure in the cultural progression of Greece.
Art
Greece is famed for its Classical Art, for example the many statues of its gods and goddesses, and pottery depicting scenes from Ancient Mythology. However, after the merging with Roman Christian culture, by the Byzantium period much art was religious (as opposed to pagan). The Renaissance painter El Greco was the most influential of Greek artists, for his bold and modern use of colour and form.
Music
Greek music has long-standing tradition in the country, with instruments such as the kithara, aulos and lyre used for celebration and devotional purposes. Much church music was resistant to the changes undergoing in the West, so instead of taking on the new polyphonic forms, Byzantine music remained monophonic, and developing in isolation like this, that form of apparently simple music reached its zenith in the expression of the Byzantine chant. Greece also has a thriving folk tradition and now embraces such popular cultures as western European dance music forms.
Sports
Greece is of course home to the Olympics, and as such can be seen as having the longest held sporting traditions in the world. The Greek football team won the Euro cup in 2004, and their basketball team is also world-renowned. Greece held the first modern Olympics in 1896.
Food
Greek cuisine is a beacon of the Mediterranean diet. It uses fresh and healthy ingredients to make such national dishes as moussaka, stifado and dolmades. Favoured ingredients include olives, fresh herbs and spices, nuts, pulses, and feta cheese.
Greece&apos;s Economic Future
Greece&apos;s economy relies in a great part on the service industry, and in particular tourism, and its GDP is one of the fastest growing in the world. However, the shipping industry also makes up a high percentage of Greece&apos;s GDP, employing 4% of the country&apos;s total workforce. Greece is well situtated geographically to take part in global developments in science and technology, with companies such as Ericsson, Siemens and Coca-Cola basing their R&amp;D headquarters in the country. Greece joined the ESA in 2005 and participates in the agency&apos;s telecommunication and technology activities, as well as the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security Initiative.</string>

		<string>Hungary, formally, until 2012, the Republic of Hungary is a landlocked country in Central Europe.It is situated in the Carpathian Basin and is bordered by Slovakia to the north, Ukraine and Romania to the east, Serbia and Croatia to the south, Slovenia to the southwest and Austria to the west. The country&apos;s capital and largest city is Budapest. Hungary is a member of the European Union, NATO, the OECD, the Visegrád Group, and the Schengen Area. The official language is Hungarian, which is the most widely spoken non-Indo-European language in Europe.
Following centuries of successive habitation by Celts, Romans, Huns, Slavs, Gepids, and Avars, the foundation of Hungary was laid in the late 9th century by the Hungarian grand prince Árpád in the Honfoglalás(&quot;homeland-conquest&quot;). His great-grandson Stephen I ascended to the throne in 1000 CE, converting the country to a Christian kingdom. By the 12th century, Hungary became a middle power within the Western world, reaching a golden age by the 15th century.Following the Battle of Mohács in 1526 and about 150 years of partial Ottoman occupation (1541–1699), Hungary came under Habsburg rule, and later formed a significant part of the Austro–Hungarian Empire (1867–1918).
Hungary&apos;s current borders were first established by the Treaty of Trianon (1920) after World War I, when the country lost 71% of its territory, 58% of its population, and 32% of ethnic Hungarians. Following the interwar period, Hungary joined the Axis Powers in World War II, suffering significant damage and casualties. Hungary came under the influence of the Soviet Union, which contributed to the establishment of a four-decade-long communist dictatorship (1947–1989). The country gained widespread international attention regarding the Revolution of 1956 and the seminal opening of its previously-restricted border with Austria in 1989, which accelerated the collapse of the Eastern Bloc.</string>
		<key>energy</key>
		<string>Hungary is one of the EU countries which utilises nuclear power, with its Paks Nuclear Power Plant contributing around 40% of the country&apos;s energy. Hungary has also embraced wind power, another sustainable form of energy, and has several wind farms across the country. In late March 2009, Russia stepped into Hungary&apos;s energy sector by buying over the shares in MOL, their energy group, from the Austrian energy group who had previously owned them. This was a controversial act, causing many both in Hungary itself and in the EC to fear Russia&apos;s increasing involvement in energy groups in that region of Eastern European countries.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Hungary, like so many other former soviet countries, underwent the difficult transition from centrally planned to market economy. The country is one of the latest members to join the EU (in 2004), and although its economy has gone through sustained growth in the past ten years, Hungary must cut down government spending and put in place reforms for the economy by 2013 in order to elligible to join the euro zone. Current reforms under discussion include health care, tax and local government financing. The private sector makes up four fifths of the country&apos;s GDP, with foreign investment mostly coming from central Europe. The majority of the country&apos;s workforce is employed in the service sector, with tourism an increasingly important industry - Hungary has been named one of the 15 top tourist attractions in the world, and is home to the largest lake and thermal lake in Europe, as well as the largest natural grassland in the continent. Natural resources include coal, natural gas and arable land, and key industries are mining, processed foods, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and motor vehicles. Hungary&apos;s main trading partners are Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Russia, Italy and the UK.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>Hungarian is the official language of Hungary, and is a Ugric language, only very distantly connected to other European languages. The Hungarian name for the language is magyar. Around 10 million of the global 14.5 million speakers of Hungarian live in Hungary itself, with others to be found in Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia and Ukraine. There are various mutually intelligble dialects of Hungarian, which include: Alföld, West Danube, Danube-Tisza, King&apos;s Pass Hungarian, Northeast Hungarian, Northwest Hungarian, Székely and West Hungarian.</string>
		<key>science</key>
		<string>Hungary is renowned for the strength of its education in mathematics, and perhaps for this reason the country has born no less than 13 Nobel prizewinners. It was a Hungarian who invented the Rubik&apos;s cube (Erno Rubik, of course!) and other Hungarian inventions include the transformer, the production line - and hence industrial mass production - and the ballpoint pen.</string>

Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the west, and the Bay of Bengal on the east, Inida is bordered by Pakistan to the west, People&apos;s Republic of China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east.

Home to the Indus Valley Civilization and a region of historic trade routes and vast empires, the Indian subcontinent was identified with its commercial and cultural wealth for much of its long history.  Furthermore, four major world religions, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism originated there, while Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity and Islam arrived in the first millennium CE and shaped the region&apos;s diverse culture. Gradually annexed by the British East India Company from the early eighteenth century and colonised by the United Kingdom from the mid-nineteenth century, India became an independent nation in 1947 after a struggle for independence that was marked by widespread nonviolent resistance.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>India has had an average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% for the past two decades, the economy is among the fastest growing in the world.  It has the world&apos;s second largest labour force, with 516.3 million people. In terms of output, the agricultural sector accounts for 28% of GDP, while the service and industrial sectors make up 54% and 18% respectively. Major agricultural products include rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, potatoes, cattle, water buffalo, sheep, goats, poultry and fish.  Major industries include textiles, chemicals, food processing, steel, transportation equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery and software.  India has been exporting increasingly as well, their exports include petroleum products, textile goods, gems and jewelry, software, engineering goods, chemicals and leather manufactures.</string>
		<key>culture</key>
		<string>India&apos;s culture is marked by a high degree of family values and cultural pluralism.  It has managed to preserve established traditions while absorbing new customs, traditions, and ideas from invaders and immigrants and spreading its cultural influence to other parts of Asia. Traditional Indian society is defined by relatively strict social hierarchy. The Indian caste system describes the social stratification and social restrictions in the Indian subcontinent, in which social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as castes.  The Inidan family is very tightly linked and they have an important relationship to religion and their own Indian traditions and customs.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>India has one of the largest selections of language dialects in the world, this includes over 25 different dialects.  This is just one exmaple of the cultural and religious abundance that India has, and at the same time they can all work together and assimilate their thoughts and beliefes into the Indian culture as a whole.  This allows everyone to benefit from this shared idea system and adds to the wealth of the Indian culture</string>

India has been workingly closely with the West to create the necessary measures of prevention in order to control this situation for the benefit of not only India, but the rest of the world. </string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>In the near future, India’s GDP per capita will quadruple and the Inidan economy is expected to surpass the American economy by 2045.  But if it can fulfill its growth potential, it can become a motor for the world economy, and a key contributor to generating spending growth.  The Indian economy has grown steadily over the last two decades, India will look to continue to grow and close the gap between its poorer and richer classes.  India has a bright economic future and will surely continue to be one of the most important economies in the world.</string>

		<string>Indonesia is an archipelago comprising thousands of islands.With an estimated total population of over 252 million people, Indonesia is the world&apos;s fourth-most-populous country. Indonesia&apos;s republican form of government comprises an elected legislature and president. It encompasses 34 provinces, of which five have Special Administrative status. The nation&apos;s capital city is Jakarta. The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea, East Timor, and Malaysia. Other neighbouring countries include Singapore, the Philippines, Australia, Palau, and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Indonesia is a founding member of ASEAN and a member of the G-20 major economies. The Indonesian economy is the world&apos;s 17th largest by nominal GDP.
The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the 7th century, when Srivijaya and then later Majapahit traded with China and India. Local rulers gradually absorbed foreign cultural, religious and political models from the early centuries CE, and Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished. Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources. Muslim traders brought the now-dominantIslam, while European powers brought Christianity and fought one another to monopolise trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Discovery. Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism, Indonesiasecured its independence after World War II. Indonesia&apos;s history has since been turbulent, with challenges posed by natural disasters, mass slaughter, corruption, separatism, a democratisation process, and periods of rapid economic change.
Indonesia consists of hundreds of distinct native ethnic and linguistic groups. The largest – and politically dominant – ethnic group are the Javanese. A shared identity has developed, defined by a national language, ethnic diversity, religious pluralism within a majority Muslim population, and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it. Indonesia&apos;s national motto, &quot;Bhinneka Tunggal Ika&quot; (&quot;Unity in Diversity&quot; literally, &quot;many, yet one&quot;), articulates the diversity that shapes the country. Despite its large population and densely populated regions, Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world&apos;s second highest level of biodiversity. The country has abundant natural resources, yet poverty remains widespread.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>There are 742 languages spoken in Indonesia, but Indonesian, the chief language, is spoken by 240 million people. Other languages spoken in Indonesia include Javanese, Sundanese, Madurese, Buginese and Balinese, and many people will speak these local languages in addition to the official Indonesian language. Indonesian is a modified form of Malay, and was first declared to be the official language of the country after Indonesia&apos;s independence in 1945. Now it is one of the most widely spoken languages spoken in the world. The language is part of a Western Malayo-Polynesian subgroup of the Austronesian languages, and is formed on a variatin of Old Malay, originally spoken in Sumatra. The language has borrowed heavily from other languages including Sanskrit, Arabic, Chinese, Dutch and Persian. </string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>With the largest economy in Southeast Asia, Indonesia is also one of the emerging world-market economies in the world. Its estimated GDP is $845.6, and the country&apos;s 108 million labour force is mostly divided between the service and industry sectors. Agriculture includes rice, tapioca, peanuts, rubber, cocoa, coffee, beef and poultry, and industries include petroleum, natural gas, textiles and mining. Indonesia&apos;s major trading partners include Japan, US, Singapore, China and Taiwan.
Deterioration in the economy after the 1960s led to widespread poverty and hunger. However, the New Order brought relative stability and attracted foreign investment, and following that the exportation of oil (through membership of OPEC), led to a period of high economic growth rates.
Indonesia was badly affected by the East Asian financial crisis in 97 and 98, and its economy shrank by around 13%. There has been a stabilisation since then and another period of economic growth, but despite that almost half of the population live beneath the poverty line.</string>

		<string>After Brazil, Indonesia has the second most biodiverse climate in the world. Made up of a mix of Asian and Australasian, its flora and fauna include species such as tiger, orangutan, rhinoceros and leopard, while forests cover approximately 60% of the country. It has a wide range of ecosystems including beaches, mangroves, forest, coral reefs, coastal mudflats and small islands. However, its rapid modernisation and industrialisation have caused damaging effect upon the country&apos;s environment, with issues of deforestation and wildfire as well as habitat destruction threatening some of its species, for example the famous example of the Sumatran Orangutan. Of recent years the country has been victim of some of the worst natural disasters of the 21st century so far; in 2004 a huge earthquake caused the tsunami that killed around 225 000 people, with Indonesia the heaviest hit. In 2006 another earthquake killed a further 6200 people, and two months later another earthquake and tsunami wreaked havoc once more. Flooding in 2007 left around 340 000 homeless.</string>

		<string>Italy, which is officially known as the Italian Republic, is a country located on the Italian Peninsula in Southern Europe and on the two largest islands in the Mediterranean Sea, Sicily and Sardinia. Italy shares its northern, Alpine boundary with France, Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia. The independent states of San Marino and the Vatican City are enclaves within the Italian Peninsula, and Campione d&apos;Italia is an Italian exclave in Switzerland.  

Italy has been the home of many European cultures, such as the Etruscans and the Romans, and later was the birthplace of the university and of the Renaissance, which began in Tuscany and spread all over Europe. Italy&apos;s capital, Rome, was for centuries the center of Western civilization. Italy possessed a colonial empire from the second half of the nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century.

Excavations throughout Italy reveal a modern human presence dating back to the Palaeolithic period, some 200,000 years ago. Ancient Rome was at first a small agricultural community founded circa the 8th century BC, that grew over the course of the centuries into a colossal empire. It encompassed the whole Mediterranean Sea, in which Ancient Greek and Roman cultures merged into one civilization. This civilization was so influential that parts of it survive in modern law, administration, philosophy and arts, forming the ground that Western civilization is based upon. In its twelve-century existence, it transformed itself from republic to monarchy and finally to autocracy. In steady decline since the 2nd century AD, the empire finally broke into two parts in 285 AD: the Western Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire in the East. The western part, under the pressure of Goths, finally dissolved, leaving the Italian peninsula divided into small independent kingdoms and feuding city states for the next 14 centuries, and leaving the eastern part sole heir to the Roman legacy.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Italy is a democratic republic with a high GDP and quality of life. It is a member of OECD, EU, NATO, G8, WTO, Council of Nations Security Council and the Council of Europe. The country is a major exporter of manufactured goods including motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals and chemicals. Tourism is also a very important industry in the country, and it is ranked as the 5th most visited place in the world.</string>
		<key>culture</key>
		<string>Since Italy did not exist as a state until the country&apos;s unification in 1861, many traditions and customs that are now recognized as distinctly Italian can be identified by their regions of origin. Despite the political and social isolation of these regions, Italy&apos;s contributions to the cultural and historical heritage of Europe remain immense. Italy is home to the greatest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites (43) to date.</string>
		<key>science</key>
		<string>Through the centuries, Italy give birth to some of the major world sceince geniuses. Leonardo da Vinci was the quintessential Renaissance Man. Galileo Galilei was a physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher who played a major role in the Scientific Revolution. His achievements include improvements to the telescope and consequent astronomical observations, and support for Copernicanism. The physicist Enrico Fermi was the leader of the team that built the first nuclear reactor; the astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini made many discoveries about the Solar System; the physicist Alessandro Volta was the inventor of the electric battery; the mathematicians Lagrange and Fibonacci made fundamental advances in mathemathics; Guglielmo Marconi received the Nobel Prize in Physics for the inventor of the radio; and Antonio Meucci was the inventor of the telephone.</string>
		<key>sport</key>
		<string>Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, waterpolo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing. Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic venues. Turin hosted the 2006 Winter Olympic Games. Sports are incorporated into Italian festivities like Palio and the gondola race that takes place in Venice on the first Sunday of September. Sports venues have extended from the gladiatorial games of Ancient Rome in the Colosseum to the Stadio Olimpico of contemporary Rome, where football clubs compete.
The most popular sport in Italy is football, the Serie A being one of the most famous competitions in the world. Italy&apos;s national football team is the second-most-successful team in the world, with four world cup victories, the first one of which was in 1934. Italy is also and the current (2006) FIFA world champion.</string>
		<key>food</key>
		<string>The modern Italian cuisine has evolved through centuries of social and political changes, with its roots reaching back to the 4th century BC. Significant change occurred with the discovery of the New World, when vegetables such as potatoes, tomatoes, bell peppers, and maize became available. However, these central ingredients of modern Italian cuisine were not introduced in scale before the 18th century.  Ingredients and dishes vary by region. However, many dishes that were once regional have proliferated in different variations across the country. Cheese and wine are major parts of the cuisine, playing different roles both regionally and nationally with their many variations.  Coffee, and more specifically espresso, has become highly important to the cultural cuisine of Italy.</string>

Japan is a stratovolcanic archipelago of 6,852 islands. The four largest are Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku, which make up about ninety-seven percent of Japan&apos;s land area. Japan&apos;s population of 126 million is theworld&apos;s tenth largest. The Greater Tokyo Area, which includes the de facto capital of Tokyo and several surrounding prefectures, is the world&apos;s largest metropolitan area, with over 30 million residents.
Archaeological research indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period. The first written mention of Japan is in Chinese history texts from the 1st century AD. Influence from other regions, mainlyImperial China, followed by periods of isolation, later from Western European influence, has characterized Japan&apos;s history. From the 12th century until 1868, Japan was ruled by successive feudal military shoguns in the name of the Emperor. Japan entered into a long period of isolation in the early 17th century, which was only ended in 1853 when a United States fleet pressured Japan to open to the West. Nearly two decades of internal conflict and insurrection followed before the Meiji Emperor was restored as head of state in 1868 and the Empire of Japan was proclaimed, with the Emperor as a divine symbol of the nation. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, victories in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War and World War I allowed Japan to expand its empire during a period of increasing militarism. The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937 expanded into part of World War II in 1941, which came to an end in 1945 following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Since adopting its revised constitution in 1947, Japan has maintained a unitary constitutional monarchy with an emperor and an elected legislature called the National Diet.</string>

		<string>Japanese is the predominantly spoken language in Japan, used by around 99% of the population. The Rkyukyan languages, including Kunigami, Okinawan and Amami, are spoken by some in Okinawa, but few children now learn these languages and dialects. Most schools now teach Japanese and English to children.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Japan&apos;s economy is one of the largest, measured by GDP, and has huge purchasing power. It is member of such organisations as G8, UN, OECD and APEC. It is also a significant global exporter and importer, and as a developed country has very high standards of life and the estimated longest life expectancy worldwide. The service sector is vital to Japanese industry, employing almost three quarters of the workforce. Japan has major industries in telecommunication, banking, real estate, transportation, as well as ships, chemicals, textiles and processed foods. Companies basd in Japan include Toyota, Honda, Canon, Sony and Nintendo. Agriculture also makes up a key part of Japan&apos;s economy, with a high percentage of Japanese land cultivated. Japan is a leading exporter of fish and seafood.</string>
		<key>environment</key>
		<string>After the Second World War, rapid economic growth led to damaging effects on Japanese environment, and also to the dwindling of Japan&apos;s natural resources in oil and gas. Today, Japan is a world-leader in environmental and sustainable solutions to energy security and climate change, and current issues include urban air pollution, waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, chemical management, international cooperation for environmental conservation, as well as climate change. Japanese made Honda and Toyoda electric hybrid cars have the highest fuel economy and lowest emissions. Under the Kyoto treaty, Japan is dedicated to reducing carbon emissions in the future, and the government implemented such initiatives as the Cool Biz campaign, which promoted energy saving by the reduction of air conditioning use in offices. Japan is ready to push industries to make severe cuts in greenhouse gases in order to stay in line with Kyoto protocol and targetetd CO2 reductions.

		<string>Jordan, officially the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, is an Arab kingdom in the Middle East, on the East Bank of the Jordan River. Jordan is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the south and east, Iraq to the north-east, Syria to the north, and Israel and Palestine to the west.
After the post-World War I division of West Asia by Britain and France, the Emirate of Transjordan was officially recognized by the Council of the League of Nations in 1922. In 1946, Jordan became an independent sovereign state officially known as the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan. After capturing the West Bank during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Abdullah I took the title King of Jordan. The name of the state was changed to The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan on 1 December 1948</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>The offiical language of Jordan is Arabic. However, English is also understood by many Jordanians, depending often on educational level and economic situation - middle and upper class Jordanians often speak English as a fluent second language. French is also spoken by some citizens while Russian is spoken by older people who learnt it in the USSR.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Jordan has significant oil shale resources, but apart from this it is a small country with limited natural resources. With a GDP of approximately $28.18 billion, the great majority of its workforce is employed in the service sector - tourism in Jordan is a very important source of income. Its other industries include textiles, mining, fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, and cement, and major trading partners are US, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, China and Germany. Jordan is currently working to try to expand its limited water supplies. Since 2000, Jordan has exported light manufactured goods such as textiles to the US with no quotas or tariffs, which has led to increased economic growth. In addition, the 2001 US-Jordan Free Trade Agreement promises to further expand Jordan&apos;s economy, moving it away from an exporter of potash and phosphates and toward areas such as IT and tourism. The low tax Aqaba Special Economic Zone is considered a model example of government-provided framework for private sector-led economic growth.

Jordan is a member of the WTO, and has been designated by the World Bank to be a lower middle income country. After the invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003, Jordan lost its oil rights which led to an acceleration in inflation.</string>
		<key>energy</key>
		<string>Jordan&apos;s oil shale reserves have led to it being dependent upon oil for its energy source, and in the future it is likely to continue in this vein, with the proposed building of the second largest oil shale power station in the world. The Arab Gas Pipeline from Egypt to the country was completed in 2003, and there are plans to extend it to the country&apos;s capital. In terms of renewable energy sources, there is the potential for utilisation of solar energy from the sun falling on Jordan&apos;s deserts, and as well as being an environmental and sustainable solution, it would also allow the desalination of sea-water. Jordan is part of the Trans-Mediterranean Renewable Energy Cooperation, a voluntary association which promotes an increase in Europe&apos;s energy by sustainable means, by transmitting non-polluting electric power to Europe from renewable sources in the Middle East and North Africa via HDVC lines.</string>

		<key>about</key>
		<string>Kazakhstan, officially the Republic of Kazakhstan, is a country in Central Asia, with its smaller part west of the Ural River in Europe.Kazakhstan is the world&apos;s largest landlocked country by land area and the ninth largest country in the world; its territory of 2,724,900 square kilometres (1,052,100 sq mi) is larger thanWestern Europe.It has borders with (clockwise from the north) Russia, China, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, and also adjoins a large part of the Caspian Sea. The terrain of Kazakhstan includes flatlands,steppe, taiga, rock canyons, hills, deltas, snow-capped mountains, and deserts. With an estimated 17 million people as of 2013 Kazakhstan is the 61st most populous country in the world, though its population density is among the lowest, at less than 6 people per square kilometre (15 people per sq. mi.). The capital is Astana, where it was moved from Almaty in 1997.
The territory of Kazakhstan has historically been inhabited by nomadic tribes. This changed in the 13th century, when Genghis Khan occupied the country. Following internal struggles among the conquerors, power eventually reverted to the nomads. By the 16th century, the Kazakhs emerged as a distinct group, divided into three jüz (ancestor branches occupying specific territories). The Russians began advancing into the Kazakh steppe in the 18th century, and by the mid-19th century all of Kazakhstan was part of the Russian Empire. Following the 1917 Russian Revolution, and subsequent civil war, the territory of Kazakhstan was reorganized several times before becoming the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic in 1936, an integral part of the Soviet Union.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>Kazakh is the official state language of Kazakhstan, spoken by 10 million people. The language is written in the Cyrillic alphabet; however, in 2006, the country&apos;s president suggested swapping to the Latin alphabet. Studies have shown that this switch would be feasible within 10 to 12 years, however the government decided that they would remain with the traditionally written version of the language. Russian, however, is the official language and is used in most business matters.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Kazakhstan&apos;s GDP is approximately $167.6 billion, but the government plans to triple that by 2015. Fifty percent of the labour force works in the service sector, and the rest is split roughly equally between the industrial and agricultural sectors. Major industries include oil, coal, iron ore, metals and arigicultural machinery, with the country&apos;s main trading partners including Russia, Bermuda, China, Germany, China and France. Kazakhstan predicts that it will be the world&apos;s chief exporter of uranium by 2010. Agriculture is an important sector of the economy - with products such as wheat, barley, cotton, rice, as well as dairy and poultry being produced. Kazakhstan is alleged to be the home of the apple.
The country&apos;s money policy is considered well-managed, and its economy stable: in 2000 it became the first former Soviet country to pay all of its debt to the IMF. The country&apos;s banking system is expanding extremely quickly, and in 1998 it implemented an ambitious pension reform programme.</string>
		<key>energy</key>
		<string>The country&apos;s leading economic sector is energy, due to the widespread production of oil and natural gas in the country. Kazakhstan&apos;s natural resources are predominantly made up of fossil fuels, and this fact has led to almost all of the $40 million foreign investment the country has attracted. There are some 2.7 billion tons of oil to be found in the country, but only 3 refineries - therefore there is not the capability for the refinement of the sheer volume of resource, and for this reason much of the crude oil is shipped to Russia. Because of its huge amounts of natural reserves, Kazakhstan&apos;s energy policy has worldwide implications, combined with its geographical location which can control the traffic of oil and gas between East and West.

In terms of renewable energy, Kazakhstan has 5 working hydroelectric plants which produce around a tenth of the country&apos;s energy, and there are plans to build a new nuclear power plant.</string>

		<string>The Republic of Kenya is a country in East Africa. It is bordered by Ethiopia to the north, Somalia to the northeast, Tanzania to the south, Uganda to the west, and Sudan to the northwest, with the Indian Ocean running along the southeast border.  The country is named after Mount Kenya, a very significant landmark and the second among the highest mountain peaks of Africa. </string>
		<key>geography</key>
		<string>From the coast on the Indian Ocean the Low plains rise to central highlands. The highlands are bisected by the Great Rift Valley, a fertile plateau in the east. The Kenyan Highlands comprise one of the most successful agricultural production regions in Africa. The highlands are the site of the highest point in Kenya (and the second highest in Africa): Mount Kenya, which reaches 5,199 metres (17,057 ft) and is also the site of glaciers. Climate varies from tropical along the coast to arid in the interior. Mount Kilimanjaro can be seen from Kenya to the South of the Tanzanian border.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>After independence, Kenya promoted rapid economic growth through public investment, encouragement of small-holder agricultural production, and incentives for private industrial investment. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annual average of 6.6% from 1963 to 1973. Agricultural production grew by 4.7% annually during the same period, stimulated by redistributing estates, diffusing new crop strains, and opening new areas to cultivation.  The wealth of Kenya continues to be the vast amount of natural resources, particularly its agricultural industry.</string>
		<key>culture</key>
		<string>Kenya is a diverse country, with many different cultures represented. Notable cultures include the Swahili on the coast, pastoralist communities in the north, and several different communities in the central and western regions. Today, the Maasai culture is well known, due to its heavy exposure from tourism, however, Maasai make up a relatively minor percentage of the Kenyan population. The Maasai are known for their elaborate upper body adornment and jewelry.  Furthermore, Kenya has an extensive music, television and theatre scene.</string>
		<key>resources</key>
		<string>Early in 2006 Chinese President Hu Jintao signed an oil exploration contract with Kenya,the latest in a series of deals designed to keep Africa&apos;s natural resources flowing to China&apos;s rapidly-expanding economy.  This will have a mutual benefit for both China and Kenya, who are both looking to keep their economies expanding on the wealth of natural resources, especially oil.  The deal allowed for China&apos;s state-controlled offshore oil and gas company, CNOOC Ltd, to prospect for oil in Kenya, which is just beginning to drill its first exploratory wells on the borders of Sudan and Somalia and in coastal waters.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>In the near future, Kenya seeks to expand its economy based on its wealth of natural resources, particularly oil.  Also, Kenya has begun to research other forms of energy for the future, such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power.</string>

		<string>Like Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, a former Soviet country, has kept Russian as its official language. In 1991 it added the Kyrgyz language and became an officially bilingual country. Keeping the Russian language ensured that Russians would feel welcome in the country, and prevent brain drain. The Kyrgyz language was written in Latin upto 1941, when it was replaced by the Cyrillic script. The Russian language was traditionally used in business, however, now, parliamentary meetings take place in Kyrgyz, with simultaneous interpreting for people not fluent in the language.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Kyrgyzstan has had financial backing from the IMF, World Bank and Asian Development Fund, but despite these measures its economy is still struggling, following the collapse of the Soviet union. Generally, though, it is dedicated to making the transition to a market economy, and the government&apos;s plans of reform in order to stabilise and eventually improve the economy led to the country&apos;s acceptance to the WTO in 1998.
The country&apos;s GDP is approximately $10.5 billion, and its workforce is mostly in agriculture and then divided between service and industry. Industries include machinery, food processing, textiles and cement, and the country&apos;s major natural resource is a wealth of hydropower. Its main trading partners are China, Kazakhstan, Switzerland and Turkey.
With agriculture its key industry, Kazakhstan&apos;s mountainous terrain suits itself to the breeding of livestock, as well as growing wheat, sugar beets, potatoes, fruit and vegetables. Metallurgy is an important industry due to the country&apos;s resources, and Kazakhstan hopes to promote foreign investment through this field.
Much local trade takes place at kiosks and bazaars, with commodities, for instance, gas, sold in jugs by the road.</string>

		<string>Laos is a landlocked country in Southeast Asia, bordered by Burma and China to the northwest, Vietnam to the east, Cambodia to the south and Thailand to the west.  As a French colony at one time, Laos would gain their independence from France in 1949.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>The economy of Laos relies heavily on investment and trade with its neighbors, Thailand, Vietnam, and, especially in the north, China.
The major roads connecting the major urban centres, in particular Route 13, have been significantly upgraded in recent years, but villages far from major roads are accessible only through unpaved roads that may not be accessible year-round. There is limited external and internal telecommunication, but mobile phones have become widespread in urban centres.</string>
		<key>agriculture</key>
		<string>Agriculture is the main industry in Laos, with rice being the main product produced.  Agriculture accounts for nealry half of the nation&apos;s GDP and employes over 80% of the total workforce.  There are estimated to be over 1,000 different varieties of rice in Laos, this has attracted much scientific research to their small nation.  Because of government created economic reform policies and foreign investment, the economy of LAOS has grown tremendously over the past decade and will continue to do so in the future as well.</string>
		<key>resources</key>
		<string>Laos imports most of its energy, but hey are rich in terms of mineral resources.  Metallurgy is also an important industry and the government hopes to attract foreign investment to develop the substantial deposits of coal, gold, bauxite, tin, copper and other valuable metals in the country. In addition, the country&apos;s plentiful water resources and mountainous terrain enable it to produce and export large quantities of hydroelectric energy.  Due to the limited amounts of oil and natural gas in the country and becasue of the success of their hydroelectric industry, Laos has undergone research and studies to develop other forms of renewable energy such as wind and solar energy. </string>
		<key>culture</key>
		<string>One of the dominant cultural influences in Laos is Theravada Buddhism, it is reflected throughout the country from language to the temple and in art, literature, performing arts, etc. Many elements of Lao culture predate Buddhism, however.  Furthermore, the country has two World Heritage Sites, Luang Prabang and Vat Phou. The government is seeking the same status for the Plain of Jars as well.  Likewise, rice is the staple food and has cultural and religious significance. There are many traditions and rituals associated with rice production in different environments, and among many ethnic groups.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>In the future, Laos looks to expand its economy and more specifically, its renewable energy and tourism industries.  Aside from looking to become an Asian leader in the tourism industry, Laos sees their nation as well ahead of the rest of Asia in terms of hydroelectric power, a completely clean and renewable energy resource.  Laos indeed has a very bright future ahead of them and will maintain their proud history and culture, while expanind their nation beyond new borders and goals.</string>

		<string>Sri Lanka, known until 1972 as Ceylon, is an island country in South Asia near the south-east of India.
Sri Lanka has maritime borders with India to the northwest and the Maldives to the southwest. Its documented history spans 3,000 years, with evidence of pre-historic human settlements dating back to at least 125,000 years. Its geographic location and deep harbours made it of great strategic importance from the time of the ancient Silk Road through to World War II.

		<string>Lithuania, officially known as the Republic of Lithuania, is a country in Northern Europe, the southernmost of the three Baltic states. Situated along the southeastern shore of the Baltic Sea, it shares borders with Latvia to the north, Belarus to the southeast, Poland, and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad to the southwest. Lithuania is a member of NATO and of the European Union. Its population is 3.4 million. Its capital and the largest city is Vilnius.

During the 14th century, Lithuania was the largest country in Europe: present-day Belarus, Ukraine, and parts of Poland and Russia were territories of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. With the Lublin Union of 1569 Poland and Lithuania formed a new state, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Commonwealth lasted more than two centuries, until neighboring countries systematically dismantled it from 1772 to 1795, with the Russian Empire annexing most of Lithuania&apos;s territory. In the wake of the First World War, Lithuania&apos;s Act of Independence was signed on February 16, 1918, declaring the re-establishment of a sovereign state. Starting in 1940, Lithuania was occupied first by the Soviet Union then Nazi Germany. As World War II neared its end in 1944 and the Nazis retreated, the Soviet Union reoccupied Lithuania. On March 11, 1990, Lithuania became the first Soviet republic to declare its renewed independence.

The first written mention of Lithuania is found in a medieval German manuscript, the Quedlinburg Chronicle, on 14 February 1009. The Lithuanian lands were united by Mindaugas in 1236, and neighbouring countries referred to it as &quot;the state of Lithuania.&quot; The official coronation of Mindaugas as King of Lithuania was on July 6, 1253, and the official recognition of Lithuanian statehood as the Kingdom of Lithuania.

During the Soviet and Nazi occupations between 1940 and 1944, Lithuania lost over 780,000 residents. Among them were around 190,000 Lithuanian Jews, one of the highest total mortality rates of the Holocaust. An estimated 120,000 to 300,000 were killed by Soviets or exiled to Siberia, while others had been sent to German forced labour camps or chose to emigrate to western countries.

Forty-six years of Soviet occupation ended with the advent of perestroika and glasnost in the late 1980s. Lithuania, led by SÄ…jÅ«dis, an anti-communist and anti-Soviet independence movement, proclaimed its renewed independence on March 11, 1990. Lithuania was the first Soviet republic to do so, though Soviet forces unsuccessfully tried to suppress this secession. The Red Army attacked the Vilnius TV Tower on the night of January 13, 1991, an act that resulted in the death of 13 Lithuanian civilians.  The last Red Army troops left Lithuania on August 31, 1993 — even earlier than they departed from East Germany.

On February 4, 1991, Iceland became the first country to recognize Lithuanian independence. Sweden was the first to open an embassy in the country. The United States of America never recognized the Soviet claim to Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Russia currently refuses to recognize the occupation of Lithuania, claiming that Lithuanians decided to join the Soviet Union voluntarily, although Russia signed a treaty with Lithuania before the disintegration of the USSR which acknowledged Lithuania&apos;s forced loss of sovereignty at the hands of the Soviets, thereby recognizing the occupation.

Present-day Lithuania has one of the fastest growing economies in the European Union. Lithuania became a full member of the Schengen Agreement on 21 December 2007 and in 2009, Lithuania will celebrate the millennium of its name. Lithuania joined the United Nations on September 17, 1991, and on May 31, 2001, it became the 141st member of the World Trade Organization. Since 1988, Lithuania has sought closer ties with the West, and so on January 4, 1994, it became the first of the Baltic states to apply for NATO membership. On March 29, 2004, it became a NATO member, and on May 1, 2004, Lithuania joined the European Union.</string>

In 1547 Martynas MaÅ¾vydas compiled and published the first printed Lithuanian book The Simple Words of Catechism, which marks the beginning of printed Lithuanian literature. He was followed by Mikalojus Daukša in Lithuania Propria with his Katechizmas. In the 16th and 17th centuries, Lithuanian literature was primarily religious. Development of the old Lithuanian literature (14th - 18th centuries) ends with Kristijonas Donelaitis, one of the most prominent authors of the Age of Enlightenment. Donelaitis poem &quot;The Seasons&quot; is a national epos and is a cornerstone of Lithuanian fiction literature.
Lithuanian literature of the first half of the 19th century with its mix of Classicism, Sentimentalism, and Romanticism features is represented by Antanas Strazdas, Dionizas Poška, Silvestras ValiÅ«nas, Maironis, Simonas StaneviÄius, Simonas Daukantas, and Antanas Baranauskas.  During Tsarist annexation of Lithuania, Lithuanian press ban was implemented, which lead to a formation of the Knygnešiai (Book smugglers) movement.

As a representative democracy with a constitutional monarch, it is headed by a grand duke, Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg, and is the world&apos;s only remaining grand duchy. Luxembourg is a developed country, with an advanced economy and the world&apos;s second highest GDP (PPP) per capita, according to the World Bank. Its central location has historically made it of great strategic importance to numerous powers, dating back to its founding as a Roman fortress, its hosting of a vital Frankish castle during the Early Middle Ages, and its role as a bastion for the Spanish Road between 16th and 17th centuries.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>French, German and Luxembourgish all have official status in the country of Luxembourg. Luxembourgish itself is a Franconian language, very similar to a German dialect spoken in the part of Germany bordering Luxembourg. Luxembourgish has unofficial national status, as the first language of almost all of the population. The education system puts stress on trilingual learning, with all three languages having equal prominence in schools.</string>
		<key>economy</key>

In the past it put forward plans to build a nuclear power station, but had to abandon construction due to widescale protests. In the future, the country will need to find ways to address the problems of climate change, and the non-sustainable and damaging effects on the environment of relying upon fossil fuels for energy, especially when their country relies upon its beautiful landscape in order to attract money from the tourist trade.</string>
		<key>culture</key>
		<string>Although Luxembourg&apos;s culture has suffered from the overshadowing dominance of its neighbouring European countries, it still has a wealth of cultural attractions as well as a rich historical heritage which attracts millions of visitors every year.

Moldova declared itself an independent state in 1991 as part of the dissolution of the Soviet Union. A new constitution was adopted in 1994. A strip of Moldovan territory on the east bank of the river Dniester has been under the de facto control of the breakaway government of Transnistria since 1990.
As a result of a decrease in industrial and agricultural output since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the relative size of the service sector in Moldova&apos;s economy has grown to dominate its GDP and currently stands at over 60%. Moldova remains, however, the poorest country in Europe</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>The Constitution of Moldova states that the Moldovan language is the official language, while the Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Moldova names the official language Romanian. The 1989 State Language Law speaks of a Moldo-Romanian linguistic identity. Recently the government of Moldova adopted a controversial National Political Conception stating that one of the priorities of the national politics of the Republic of Moldova is the insurance of the existence of the Moldovan language.  In localities with significant minority populations, other languages also are used alongside the state language. Russian is provided with the status of a &quot;language of interethnic communication&quot;, and remains widely used on all levels of the society and the state. According to the above-mentioned National Political Conception, Russian-Moldovan bilingualism is characteristic for Moldova.</string>

Moldova currently aspires to join the European Union and has implemented the first three-year Action Plan within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy.  There are currently many economic challenges facing Moldova, including its reputation as Europe&apos;s poorest and least developed country. However recent progress has been made. Moldova enjoys a favorable climate and good farmland but has no major mineral deposits. As a result, the economy depends heavily on agriculture, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine, and tobacco. The air of the country is very clean also extremely clean.After the break up of the Soviet Union in 1991, energy shortages contributed to sharp production declines. As part of an ambitious economic liberalization effort, Moldova introduced a convertible currency, liberalized all prices, stopped issuing preferential credits to state enterprises, backed steady land privatization, removed export controls, and liberalized interest rates. The government entered into agreements with the World Bank and the IMF to promote growth. Recent trends indicate that the Communist government intends to reverse some of these policies, and recollectivise land while placing more restrictions on private business. The economy returned to positive growth, of 2.1% in 2000 and 6.1% in 2001. Growth remained strong in 2007 (6%), in part because of the reforms and because of starting from a small base.</string>

These successful reforms have raised the GDP in Macedonia, while at the same time lowering the tax rates, in order to attract foreign investment.  This had a particular impact on the trade industry in Macedonia, where textiles, iron, steel, wine and vegetables are their most important exports.</string>

		<string>As a small country, Macedonia imports most of its oil and fuel needs, mainly from Russia and a small amount from Africa.  This has led the Macedonian government to undergo extensive research into renewable resources, such as wind, solar and hydroelectric.  Macedonia aims to have 25% of its energy requirements coming from renewable resources by 2020.  They believe this goal can be obtained by government funding and support and perhaps foreign investment opportunities as well</string>

		<string>Starting in the 1970s, Malaysia started the process of becoming a Tiger economy, such as Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong, and put emphasis on the transition from mining and agriculture to manufacturing - a process which was successful in part due to Japanese investment.
Malaysia&apos;s estimated GDP is $357 billion, with the majority of its workforce employed in the service sector. Key industries are rubber, light manufacturing, electronics, tin mining, logging and petroleum. Exports are an important means of economic growth in the country, and include electronic equipment and petroleum, to trading partners such as US, Singapore, Japan, China, Hong Kong and Germany.
At the start of the 21st century, increased government spending coincided with the rejuvenation of the country&apos;s economy, and in 2006, Malaysia put a ban on short selling. It is currently considered a newly industrialised country.</string>

The southernmost point of continental Eurasia, Tanjung Piai, is in Malaysia, located in the tropics. It is one of 17 megadiverse countries on earth, with large numbers of endemic species.
Malaysia has its origins in the Malay kingdoms present in the area which, from the 18th century, became subject to the British Empire. The first British territories were known as the Straits Settlements, whose establishment was followed by the Malay kingdoms becoming British protectorates. The territories on Peninsular Malaysia were first unified as the Malayan Union in 1946. Malaya was restructured as the Federation of Malaya in 1948, and achieved independence on 31 August 1957. Malaya united with North Borneo, Sarawak, and Singapore on 16 September 1963, with si being added to give the new country the name Malaysia.

		<string>The United Mexican States, commonly known as Mexico, is a federal constitutional republic in North America. It is bordered on the north by the United States; on the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; on the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and on the east by the Gulf of Mexico.  Mexico is a federation comprising of thirty-one states and a federal district, the capital Mexico City, whose metropolitan area is one of the world&apos;s most populous. Covering almost 2 million square kilometres, Mexico is the fifth-largest country in the Americas by total area and the 14th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of 109 million, it is the 11th most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world.

During the Pre-Columbian era complex cultures began to form in Mesoamerica. Many matured into advanced civilizations such as the Olmec, the Toltec, the Teotihuacan, the Maya and the Aztec before the first contact with Europeans. Mexico became a colony of Spain from the landing of Hernán Cortés in 1521 until its independence in 1821. The country&apos;s post-independence period was characterized by economic instability, territorial secession and civil war, including foreign intervention, two empires and two long domestic dictatorships. The latter led to the Mexican Revolution in 1910, culminating with the promulgation of Mexico&apos;s current Constitution in 1917.

As a regional power and the only Latin American member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) since 1994, Mexico is firmly established as an upper middle-income country.  The economy is strongly linked to those of its North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) partners. Despite being considered an emerging power, the uneven distribution of income and the increase in insecurity are issues of concern.

Elections held in July 2000 marked the first time that an opposition party won the presidency from the Institutional Revolutionary Party which had held it since 1929, culminating the political alternation at the federal level, which had begun at the local level during the 1980s.

Human presence in Mesoamerica was once thought to date back 40,000 years based upon what were believed to be ancient human footprints discovered in the Valley of Mexico, but after further investigation using radiometric dating, it appears this is untrue.  It is currently unclear whether 21,000 year old fire remains found in the Valley of Mexico are the earliest human remains found in the region.  For thousands of years, Mesoamerica was a land of hunter-gatherers. Around 9,000 years ago, ancient indigenous peoples domesticated corn and initiated an agricultural revolution, leading to the formation of many complex civilizations.  These civilizations revolved around cities with writing, monumental architecture, astronomical studies, mathematics, and large militaries. For almost three thousand years, Aridoamerica and Mesoamerica were the site of several advanced Amerindian civilizations.

In 1519, the native civilizations of Mesoamerica were invaded by Spain, among them the Aztecs, Mayans, etc. This was one of the most important conquest campaigns in America. Two years later, in 1521, the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan was conquered by the Spaniards along with the Tlaxcaltecs, the main enemies of the Aztecs, marking the end of the Aztec and giving rise to the Viceroyalty of New Spain in 1535. It became the first and largest provider of resources for the Spanish Empire and the most populous of all Spanish colonies.  The New Spain (1535 to 1821) was an important period in Mexico&apos;s history, when much of the nation&apos;s identity and traditions were created and several cities were built, among them Mexico City, Guadalajara, Veracruz, and Queretaro.

The war of Mexican independence, which ended in 1821, was one of the longest in the Americas, which eventually led to the independence and creation of the ephemeral First Mexican Empire.[citation needed]

The Empire&apos;s territory encompassed the area of the current Mexican republic as well as the present-day U.S. states of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, parts of Colorado and Wyoming, and all current Central American countries except for Panama. Agustín de Iturbide was the first and only emperor. Two years later, he was deposed by the republican forces. The Central American states separated, forming the Federal Republic of Central America. In 1824, a republican constitution was drafted creating the United Mexican States with Guadalupe Victoria as its first President.</string>

		<string>Tourism
According to the World Tourism Organization, Mexico has one of the largest tourism industries in the world. In 2005 it was the seventh most popular tourist destination worldwide, receiving over 20 million tourists per year, it is the only country in Latin America to be within the top 25. Tourism is also the third largest sector in the country&apos;s industrial GDP.  The most notable tourist draws are the ancient Meso-American ruins, and popular beach resorts. The coastal climate and unique culture – a fusion of European (particularly Spanish) and Meso-American cultures; also make Mexico attractive. The peak tourist seasons in Mexico are during December and during July and August, with brief surges during the week before Easter and during spring break at many of the beach resort sites which are popular among vacationing college students from the United States.  Mexico is the twenty-third highest tourism spender in the world, and the highest in Latin America
The Arts
Mexican culture reflects the complexity of the country&apos;s history through the blending of pre-Hispanic civilizations and the culture of Spain, imparted during Spain&apos;s 300-year colonization of Mexico. Exogenous cultural elements mainly from the United States have been incorporated into Mexican culture. As was the case in most Latin American countries, when Mexico became an independent nation, it had to slowly create a national identity, being an ethnically diverse country in which, for the most part, the only connecting element amongst the newly independent inhabitants was Catholicism.
Cinema
Mexican films from the Golden Age in the 1940s and 1950s are the greatest examples of Latin American cinema, with a huge industry comparable to the Hollywood of those years. Mexican films were exported and exhibited in all of Latin America and Europe. Maria Candelaria (1944) by Emilio Fernández, was one of the first films awarded a Palme d&apos;Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1946, the first time the event was held after World War II. Famous actors and actresses from this period include María Félix, Pedro Infante, Dolores del Río, Jorge Negrete and the comedian Cantinflas.
More recently, films such as Como agua para chocolate (1992), Cronos (1993), Amores perros (2000), Y tu mamá también (2001), El Crimen del Padre Amaro (2002), Pan&apos;s Labyrinth (2006) and Babel (2006) have been successful in creating universal stories about contemporary subjects, and were internationally recognised, as in the prestigious Cannes Film Festival. Mexican directors Alejandro González Iñárritu (Amores perros, Babel), Alfonso Cuarón (Children of Men, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban), Guillermo del Toro, Carlos Carrera (The Crime of Father Amaro), and screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga are some of the most known present-day film makers.
Two of the major television networks based in Mexico are Televisa and TV Azteca. Televisa is also the largest producer of Spanish-language content in the world and also the world&apos;s largest Spanish-language media network.  Grupo Multimedios is another media conglomerate with Spanish-language broadcasting in Mexico, Spain, and the United States. Soap operas are translated to many languages and seen all over the world with renowned names like Verónica Castro, Lucía Méndez, Lucero, and Thalía. Even Gael García Bernal and Diego Luna from Y tu mamá también and current Zegna model have appeared in some of them. Some of their TV shows are modeled after counterparts from the U.S. like Family Feud (100 Mexicanos Dijeron or &quot;A hundred Mexicans said&quot; in Spanish) and ¿Qué dice la gente?, Big Brother, American Idol, Saturday Night Live and others. Nationwide news shows like Las Noticias por Adela on Televisa resemble a hybrid between Donahue and Nightline. Local news shows are modeled after counterparts from the U.S. like the Eyewitness News and Action News formats. Border cities receive television and radio stations from the U.S., while satellite and cable subscription is common for the middle-classes in major cities, and they often watch movies and TV shows from the U.S.
Cuisine
Mexican cuisine is known for its intense and varied flavors, colorful decoration, and variety of spices. Most of today&apos;s Mexican food is based on pre-hispanic traditions, including the Aztecs and Maya, combined with culinary trends introduced by Spanish colonists. The conquistadores eventually combined their imported diet of rice, beef, pork, chicken, wine, garlic and onions with the native pre-Columbian food, including maize, tomato, vanilla, avocado, papaya, pineapple, chili pepper, beans, squash, limes sweet potato, peanut and turkey.
The most internationally recognized dishes include chocolate, tacos, quesadillas, enchiladas, burritos, tamales and mole among others. Regional dishes include mole poblano, chiles en nogada and chalupas from Puebla; cabrito and machaca from Monterrey, cochinita pibil from Yucatán, Tlayudas from Oaxaca, as well as barbacoa, chilaquiles, milanesas, and many others.
Sport
Mexico City hosted the XIX Olympic Games in 1968, making it the only Latin American city to do so.  The country has also hosted the FIFA World Cup twice, in 1970 and 1986.  Mexico’s most popular sport is association football. It is commonly believed that Football was introduced in Mexico by Cornish miners at the end of the 19th century.  Football became a professional sport in 1943. Since the “Era Professional” started, Mexico’s top clubs have been Guadalajara with 11 championships, América with 10 and Toluca with 9.[147] In Mexican Football many players have been raised to the level of legend, but two of them have received international recognition above others. Antonio Carbajal was the first player to appear in 5 World Cups, and Hugo Sánchez was named best CONCACAF player of the 20th century by IFFHS. Mexican’s biggest stadiums are Estadio Azteca, Estadio Olímpico Universitario and Estadio Jalisco.</string>

		<key>about</key>
		<string>Mozambique is a country in Southeast Africa bordered by the Indian Ocean to the east, Tanzania to the north, Malawi and Zambia to the northwest, Zimbabwe to the west, and Swaziland and South Africa to the southwest. It is separated from Madagascar by the Mozambique Channel to the east. The capital and largest city is Maputo (previously called Lourenço Marques before independence).
Between the 1st and 5th centuries AD, Bantu-speaking peoples migrated from farther north and west. Swahili, and later also Arab, commercial ports existed along the coasts until the arrival of Europeans. The area was explored by Vasco da Gama in 1498 and colonized by Portugal from 1505. After over four centuries of Portuguese rule, Mozambique gained independence in 1975, becoming the People&apos;s Republic of Mozambique shortly thereafter. After only two years of independence, the country descended into an intense and protracted civil war lasting from 1977 to 1992. In 1994, Mozambique held its first multiparty elections and has remained a relatively stable presidential republic since.</string>

		<string>Although the offiical language of Namibia is English, it is spoken by less than one percent of the population, while Oshiwambo languages are spoken by almost half. Other languages spoken include Afrikaans, Khoekhoe, Kavango, Herero, Otjiherero, Caprivi as well as German and English.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Namibia&apos;s economy works on free-market trading principles, and is based on capital-intensive farming and industry. Namibia&apos;s workforce is predominantly employed in the industry sector, for example in manufacture and mining. The country has a high unemployment rate due to the severely damaging effects on the population caused by AIDS/HIV. Most of Namibia&apos;s imports come from nearby South Africa, while the country itself has natural resources of diamonds, copper, uranium, tin, natural gas, hydropower, fish, oil and coal. Other important industries include meatpacking, fish processing, dairy products and mining.

Subsistence agriculture is a vital industry in the country, and much of the population relies on this sector for their income. Namibia&apos;s economy is more prosperous than the poorest countries in Africa, but despite this there is still a large percentage of the population that lives in poverty. For this reason, the development of wildlife conservancies, as well as the privatisation of state sectors, is under way in order to attract foreign investment and expand the economy. Namibia is a member of the World Bank and IMF, and has signed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</string>
		<key>tourism</key>
		<string>Namibia attracts many ecotourists, who visit the country in order to see its biodiverse climate and landscape, for example its major deserts. As well as wildlife reserves, extreme sports are popular and attract tourists, for example sandboarding and 4x4. Popular visitor attractions include the Caprivi Strip, the Skeleton Coast Park, Etosha Pan, Walvis Bay and Luderitz.

Namibia is a unique country because of the fact that within its constitution it specifies the need for conservation and the protection of wildlife reserves and ecosystems. The country has received funding from the United States Agency for International Development, and is supported by the Ministry of Environment and Tourism, USAID, WWF, Endangered Wildlife Trust - which together form a Community Based Natural Resource Management support structure.</string>

		<string>Nepal, officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, is a landlocked country in South Asia and is the world&apos;s youngest republic. It is bordered to the north by the People&apos;s Republic of China, and to the south, east, and west by the Republic of India. Kathmandu is the nation&apos;s capital and the country&apos;s largest metropolitan city. Nepal is a country of highly diverse and rich geography, culture, and religions. The mountainous north contains eight of the world&apos;s ten highest mountains, including the highest, Mount Everest. The fertile and humid south is heavily urbanized. Although Hinduism is practiced by a majority of the population, the nation also has a strong Buddhist tradition, as it is the birthplace of Gautama Buddha.

Nepal had been a monarchy throughout most of its history. Prithvi Narayan Shah, a Shah dynasty king, unified the many small kingdoms in 1768. Since then, the country had been ruled by a dynasty of kings. However, a decade-long civil war by the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) along with several weeks of mass protests by all major political parties of Nepal in 2006, culminated in a peace accord and the ensuing elections for the constituent assembly voted overwhelmingly in favor of the abdication of the last Nepali monarch Gyanendra Shah and the establishment of a federal democratic republic in 2008. The first President of Nepal, Dr Ram Baran Yadav was sworn in on 23 July, 2008.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Agriculture accounts for much of Nepal&apos;s economy, with produce grown including tea, rice, wheat, corn and milk. Its exports of textiles and jute total around $822 million, and its trading partners include India, China and Saudi Arabia. The country receives foreign aid, but there is future possibility for the growth of the tourism industry due to the country&apos;s varied and beautifully diverse landscape</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>Nepal&apos;s diverse linguistic heritage evolved from four major language groups: Indo-Aryan, Tibeto-Burman, Mongolian and various indigenous language isolates. According to the 2001 national census, 92 different living languages are spoken in Nepal. The major languages of Nepal are Nepali (57%), Maithili (10%), Bhojpuri (7%), Tharu (4%), Tamang (5%), Newari/Nepal Bhasa (3%), Magar (2%), Awadhi (2%), Rai (2.79%), Limbu (1%), and Bajjika (1%). The remaining 81 languages are each spoken as mother tongue by less than one percent of the population. Nepal&apos;s constitution, however, guarantees that, irrespective of what the official language is, all languages spoken in Nepal can be used for official purposes and documentation.

Derived from Sanskrit, Nepali is considered the language closest to Sanskrit and written in Devanagari script. Nepali is the official, national language and serves as lingua franca among Nepalis of different ethnolinguistic groups. Hindi -- along with regional dialects Awadhi, Bhojpuri and Maithili -- are spoken in the southern Terai Region. Hindi is also widely understood by Nepalis who have worked, studied or traveled in India. Many Nepali in government and business speak English as well. In the capital Kathmandu, Nepali, Nepal Bhasa and English are the most widely understood languages.</string>
		<key>culture</key>
		<string>Nepalese culture is diverse, reflecting different ethnic origins of the people. The Newar community is particularly rich in cultural diversity; they celebrate many festivals, well known for their music and dance. A typical Nepalese meal is dal-bhat-tarkari. Dal is a spicy lentil soup, served over bhat (boiled rice), served with tarkari (curried vegetables) together with achar (pickles) or chutni (spicy condiment made from fresh ingredients).. The Newar community, however, has its own unique cuisine. It consists of non-vegetarian as well as vegetarian items served with alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Mustard oil is the cooking medium and a host of spices, such as cumin, coriander, black peppers, sesame seeds, turmeric, garlic, ginger, methi, bay leaves, cloves, cinnamon, pepper, chillies, mustard seeds, etc., are used in the cooking. The cuisine served on festivals is generally the best.
The Nepali year begins in mid-April and is divided into 12 months. Saturday is the official weekly holiday. Main annual holidays include the National Day, celebrated on the birthday of the king (December 28), Prithvi Jayanti (January 11), Martyr&apos;s Day (February 18), and a mix of Hindu and Buddhist festivals such as dashain in autumn, and tihar in late autumn. During tihar, the Newar community also celebrates its New Year as per their local calendar Nepal Sambat. Nepal&apos;s flag is the only national flag in the world that is non-quadrilateral in shape, and one of only two non-rectangular flags in use (the other being the flag of the US state of Ohio). According to its official description, the red in the flag stands for victory in war or courage, and is also color of the rhododendron, the national flower of Nepal. Red also stands for aggression. The flag&apos;s blue border signifies peace. The curved moon on the flag is a symbol of the peaceful and calm nature of Nepalese, while the sun represents the aggressiveness of Nepalese warriors.</string>

		<key>about</key>
		<string>In 1579, the northern part of the Seventeen Provinces formed the Union of Utrecht, and this was the formation of the Netherlands. After independence from Philip II, seven provinces formed the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands. Otherwise known as the Dutch Republic, by the 17th century, in its Golden Age, Holland was one of the leading economic and seafaring powers, its empire extended over the globe and its population increased from 1.5 to 2 million. The Netherlands is consiered by many to be the first capitalist country in the world, with Amsterdam the wealthiest trading city, housing the first full-time stock exchange.

In 1795, with the flight of William of Orange to England, the Batavian Republic was proclaimed, making Holland a unitary state, and republic after the model of the French Republic. Napoleon set up the Kingdom of Holland and between 1810 and 1813 (when Napoleon was defeated at the Battle of Leipzig), Holland fell under the French Empire.

In 1815, the United Kingdom of the Netherlands was formed, but by 1830 the union between Holland and Belgium was severed. During this time, the Netherlands possessed several colonies abroad, such as the Dutch East Indies - now Indonesia - and Suriname, which were administered by the Dutch East and West India Companies.

Holland remained neutral during World War I because of their diplomacy and ability to trade. They intented to remain neutral in World War II, however they were invaded by Nazi Germany. Under occupation, over 100 000 Dutch Jews were sent to concentration camps. Anne Frank gained notoriety for her diary, written while in hiding from the Germans in a house in Amsterdam, but later sent, with the rest of her family, to concentration camps.

After the war, Dutch economy thrived, with the Netherlands becoming one of the founding countries of Benelux - made up of Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg. The 60s and 70s were a time of great social and cultural revolution, with youth movements pushing for changes in women&apos;s rights, sexual issues, disarmament and environmental issues. Today, Holland is famed for its liberal nature,  being one of the only countries where euthanasia is legalised, and same-sex marriage has been allowed since 2001.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>The Netherlands was a founding member of the EU, and also a member of OECD, NATO and has signed the Kyoto protocol. Its economy is wealthy, and its industries are focused on food production, electronics, chemicals and petroleum refining. Its economy is the 16th largest in the world. Tourism is also a very important industry, as it is the fifth most visited country in Europe. Netherlands houses one of the largest natural gas fields in the world, and agriculture - for example the exportation of tomatoes and peppers - also makes up a large percentage of the economy.</string>
		<key>culture</key>
		<string>Tourism
Amsterdam hosts millions of tourists every year who flock there to visit its infamous red light district and coffeeshops, as well as stereotyped items such as windmills, clogs, Delftware and cheese. However, apart from the sex and drugs trade, the Netherlands, and Amsterdam in particular, has a thriving cultural life, boasting attractions such as the vast Rijksmuseum, with more than 7 million items in its collection, the Van Gogh museum, Rembrandt and Anne Frank houses, as well as the Mauritshuis in the Haag. The Netherlands also has several beach resorts, and though a small country, has many small towns of interest, such as the historical town of Leiden, not to mention the famed wide, tree-lined streets with grand 17th century architecture overlooking the linking canal systems of its chief cities.
Language
The official language of the Netherlands is Dutch, which bears many similarities to both German and English. However, almost all of the population, especially in Amsterdam, speak fluent English. Another official language is West Frisian, which is spoken in the northern province of Friesland. As well as the 70% of the population that speak English, 55-59% of Dutch people also speak German.
Literature
Literature flourished during the Dutch Golden Age. As well as philosophers such as Erasmus and Spinoza, and much of Descartes&apos; great works being written in the country, Joost van den Vondel and P.C. Hooft were famed writers of the 17th century. Important 20th century authors include Mulisch, Wolkers, Nooteboom and Frederik Hermans. Anne Frank&apos;s Diary, published after her death has been published in every language worldwide.
Art
Foremost amongst the Dutch Masters is Rembrandt van Rijn, whose paintings were characterised by sombre, proto-impressionistic backgrounds and staggeringly revelatory portraits using the chiaroscuro effects of light and dark. Dutch painters after him specialised in striking use of light, for example Vermeer who often depicted characters standing in beams of light, and other interior painters such as Jan Steen who captured still and quiet snapshops of the minutiae of Dutch life in the 17th century. Another important trend in Dutch painting is landscapes, with painters such as Ruysdael evoking the huge sky-scapes of a country known for its flatness. Famous graphic artist M.C. Escher was from the Netherlands, as were Vincent van Gogh and de Stijl painter Piet Mondrian. Much 20th century Dutch art can be seen in the Gemeentemuseum in the Haag.
Cuisine
Dutch cooking has been the subject of many cruel jokes by other European countries, but in reality, like many other countries on the continent, it borrows dishes from key countries such as Italy, Germany and France. There is more to Dutch cooking than the cheese and ham toastie, though this is perhaps not known by the millions of tourists who visit the capital every year. For example, there are a variety of fine Dutch cheeses such as Edam and Gouda, and many pancake-houses which serve both sweet and savoury Dutch pancakes. A favourite drink is the Dutch gin Jenever, which has two types, old and new, and is drunk as an accompaniment to beer</string>

		<string>New Zealand is an island country in the south-western Pacific Ocean comprising two main landmasses and numerous smaller islands, most notably Stewart Island/Rakiura and the Chatham Islands. The indigenous Maori named New Zealand Aotearoa, commonly translated as The Land of the Long White Cloud. The Realm of New Zealand also includes the Cook Islands and Niue, Tokelau and the Ross Dependency (New Zealand&apos;s territorial claim in Antarctica).  New Zealand is notable for its geographic isolation, situated about 2000 km (1250 miles) southeast of Australia across the Tasman Sea, and its closest neighbours to the north are New Caledonia, Fiji and Tonga. During its long isolation New Zealand developed a distinctive fauna dominated by birds, a number of which became extinct after the arrival of humans and the mammals they introduced.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>New Zealand has a modern, prosperous, developed economy with an estimated GDP of US$115.624 billion.  The country has a relatively high standard of living with an estimated GDP per capita of US$27,017, comparable to Southern Europe.  New Zealanders have a high level of life satisfaction as measured by international surveys; this is despite lower GDP per-head levels than many other OECD countries. The country was ranked 20th on the 2008 Human Development Index and 15th in The Economist&apos;s 2005 worldwide quality-of-life index.  The country was ranked 1st in life satisfaction and 5th in overall prosperity in the 2007 Legatum Institute prosperity index.  Taxation in New Zealand is lighter than in other OECD countries, while New Zealand is one of the most free market capitalist economies according to economic freedom indices.</string>
		<key>agriculture</key>
		<string> Agriculture has been and continues to be the main export industry in New Zealand. In the year to June 2007, dairy products accounted for 21% ($7.5 billion) of total merchandise exports and the largest company of the country, Fonterra, a dairy cooperative, controls almost one-third of the international dairy trade.  Other agricultural items were meat 13.2%, wood 6.3%, fruit 3.5% and fishing 3.3%.  Livestock are rarely housed, but are sometimes fed small quantities of supplements such as hay and silage, particularly in winter. Grass growth is seasonal, largely dependent on location and climatic fluctuations but normally occurs for between 8-12 months of the year. Stock are grazed in paddocks, often with moveable electric fencing around the farm. Lambing and calving are carefully managed to take full advantage of spring grass growth.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>New Zealand will look to continue to grow based upon its natural resources and agricultural strengths.  While their economy has not been growing as rapidly as some other nations, they have been steadily growing and enjoy one of the highest average quality of life ratings of anywhere in the world.</string>

		<string>Niger, officially the Republic of Niger, is a landlocked country in Western Africa, named after the Niger River. Niger covers a land area of almost 1,270,000 km2, making it the largest nation in West Africa, with over 80 percent of its land area covered by the Sahara desert. The country&apos;s predominantly Islamic population of 17,138,707 is mostly clustered in the far south and west of the nation. The capital city is Niamey, located in the far-southwest corner of Niger.
Niger is a developing country, and is consistently one of the lowest-ranked in the United Nations&apos; Human Development Index (HDI); it was ranked last at 187th for 2013. Much of the non-desert portions of the country are threatened by periodic drought and desertification. The economy is concentrated around subsistence and some export agriculture clustered in the more fertile south, and the export of raw materials, especially uranium ore. Niger faces serious challenges to development due to its landlocked position, desert terrain, poor education and poverty of its people, lack of infrastructure, poor health care, and environmental degradation.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>French is the official language of Niger, but is spoken mainly by those members of the population who have received an education. There are also several indigenous languages, such as Hausa, Zarma and Songhai, Tamajeq, Fulfulde, Kanuri, Colloquial Arabic, Gurmantche and Toubou.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Like many other African states, Niger&apos;s economy is reliant upon subsistence agriculture, and this makes up a large percentage of population income. Agricultural produce such as livestock, pearl millet, sorghum, cassava, peppers, cowpeas, onions, garlic, potatoes and wheat make up the country&apos;s major exports. However, the country&apos;s main export is Uranium, of which there are significant natural reserves.

		<string>Nigeria, officially the Federal Republic of Nigeria, is a federal constitutional republic comprising thirty-six states and one Federal Capital Territory. The country is located in West Africa and shares land borders with the Republic of Benin in the west, Chad and Cameroon in the east, and Niger in the north. Its coast lies on the Gulf of Guinea, a part of the Atlantic Ocean, in the south. The capital city is Abuja. The three largest and most influential ethnic groups in Nigeria are the Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba. The people of Nigeria have an extensive history, and archaeological evidence shows that human habitation of the area dates back to at least 9000 BCE.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>The number of languages currently estimated and catalogued in Nigeria is 521. This number includes 510 living languages, two second languages without native speakers and nine extinct languages. In some areas of Nigeria, ethnic groups speak more than one language. The official language of Nigeria, English, was chosen to facilitate the cultural and linguistic unity of the country. The choice of English as the official language was partially related to the fact that a part of the Nigerian population spoke English as a result of the British colonization that ended in 1960.

The major languages spoken in Nigeria represent three major families of African languages - the majority are Niger-Congo languages, such as Yoruba, Igbo, the Hausa language is Afro-Asiatic; and Kanuri, spoken in the northeast, primarily Borno State, is a member of the Nilo-Saharan family. Even though most ethnic groups prefer to communicate in their own languages, English, being the official language, is widely used for education, business transactions and for official purposes. English as a first language, however, remains an exclusive preserve of a small minority of the country&apos;s urban elite, and it is not spoken at all in some rural areas.</string>
		<key>environment</key>
		<string>Nigeria has a varied landscape which ranges from the Obudu Hills in the southeast through the beaches in the south, the rainforest, the Lagos estuary and savannah in the middle and southwest of the country and the Sahel to the encroaching Sahara in the extreme north. The highest point in Nigeria is Chappal Waddi at 2,419 m (7,936 ft).  Nigeria&apos;s main rivers are the Niger and the Benue which converge and empty into the Niger Delta, the world&apos;s largest river deltas.  Nigeria&apos;s Delta region, home of the large oil industry, experiences serious oil spills and other environmental problems.  Waste management including sewage treatment, the linked processes of deforestation and soil degradation, and climate change or global warming are the major environmental issues in Nigeria.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Nigeria is classified as an emerging market, and is rapidly approaching middle income status with its abundant supply of resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, transport sectors and stock exchange (the Nigerian Stock Exchange), which is the second largest in Africa.  Africa is in the top 10 exporters of goods to the United States and the close communication that Nigeria has to the United States is one of the many reasons for their continued economic success.</string>
		<key>resources</key>
		<string>Nigeria also has a wide array of underexploited mineral resources which include natural gas, coal, bauxite, tantalite, gold, tin, iron ore, limestone, niobium, lead and zinc.  Despite huge deposits of these natural resources, the mining industry in Nigeria is still in it infancy, but the government is passing legilation and reforms to expand this wealth of resources into a huge industry for the nation.  Agriculture used to be the principal foreign exchange earner of Nigeria, at one time, Nigeria was the world&apos;s largest exporter of groundnuts, cocoa, and palm oil and a significant producer of coconuts, citrus fruits, maize, pearl millet, cassava, yams and sugar cane. About 60% of Nigerians work in the agricultural sector, and Nigeria has vast areas of underutilized arable land.  It also has a manufacturing industry which includes leather and textiles, car manufacturing (for the French car manufacturer Peugeot as well as for the English truck manufacturer Bedford, now a subsidiary of General Motors), t-shirts, plastics and processed food.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>Nigeria looks to continue to grow in the near future, and is predicted to be one of the top 15 economies in the world by 2020.  It will expand on its strengths of natural resources, including ariable farmland, as well as a huge and productive labour force.  Also Nigeria has tremendous oil and coal resources and a very bright future, which will continue to prosper in the years to come.</string>

		<string>Norway was inhabited from as early as the 6th millennium BC. However, it was only after the unification of the petty states by Harold Hairfair that Norway became one united country, and so started the Viking period between the 8th and 11th centuries. This era was a time of expansion and emigration, with many Norwegians leaving the country to settle in Iceland, Greenland and parts of Britain and Ireland. By the 11th century, many Norse traditions were being replaced by Christian ideologies, with St. Olav Haakon the Good the country&apos;s first Christian king. In 1319 Norway and Sweden were joined, and in 1349 the Black Death killed 60% of the population, leading to a period of economic decline. There were many unions between the Nordic countries, bringing Norway, Sweden and Denmark together under the Kalmar Union, which Norway remained in until 1814. Later, during the romanticism of the 19th century, this period was known as the &quot;Four Hundred Year Night&quot;, because all of the country&apos;s intellectual, political and royal power was centred in Denmark.

Norway formed a disastrous alliance with Napoleon, which led to mass starvation, however was then able to declare independence in 1814 with Christian Frederik crowned king. The country formed an alliance with Sweden which was peacefully broken in 1905. During the First World War, Norway remained neutral, but during World War II was invaded by German forces, meaning they had to participate. After the war, for over fifteen years, labour held the majority vote in the country, while the wartime alliances with UK and the US prevailed during these years. Norway founded the 1973 State oil company after discovering oil, and was one of the founding nations of the European Free Trade Area. By the 1990s the country had paid off its foreign debts.</string>

		<key>language</key>
		<string>The Norwegian language has two distinct forms, Bokmal and Nynorsk. They are both official and hold equal status in administration, schools and in the media - however, despite this Bokmal is used by the majority of Norwegian speakers. 95% of the population speak Norwegian as their mother tongue, however there are many differing dialects which although mostly understandable to standard Norwegian speakers, still differ greatly. There are many speakers of the Sami language in the country, which is considered another official language. Norwegian is very similar to other Scandinavian languages, while the main foreign language taught in schools is English, with the majority of the population fluent in this as a second language.</string>
		<key>culture</key>
		<string>Literature
Norwegian literature started with pagan poems coming out of the oral tradition in the 12th and 13th centuries. There was a relative lull in aritistic output then, but this ended with the National Romanticism movement in the late 18th century, with writers such as Weregelland, Moe and Collett. The 19th century golden-age of Nordic literature featured four key writers: Ibsen, Bjornson, Kielland and Lie. Ibsen remains the country&apos;s chief dramatist, but in the 20th century three writers won the Nobel prize for literature. Prominent contemporary writers include Jostein Gaarder, Per Petterson and Johan Borgen.
Music
Grieg is the most famous of Norway&apos;s classical composers, with his ballet Peer Gynt an enduring favourite in the classical canon. Norway has a long-standing tradition of folk music, and now embraces a wide range of musical forms, including blues, jazz, pop and rock.
Cuisine
Although Norway has now embraced contemporary European cuisines such as Italian and French, its own cooking is based on game and fish. Smoked salmon is a Norwegian delicacy which now has worldwide popularity, and other forms of seafood are eaten across the country. Kjottkaker is the name for Norwegian meatballs, while Svinestek is a roasted pork dish, eaten on Sundays.</string>

The nation has limited renewable water resources, with 94% used in farming and 2% for industrial activity. Drinking water is available throughout the country, either piped or delivered. Both drought and limited rainfall contribute to shortages in the nation&apos;s water supply.  This has prompted the government to undergo research and studies to better understand and possibly control the effects of climate change.</string>

		<string>Oil has been drilled Oman since the 1970&apos;s and this is one of the main exports of the nation.  The chief drilling operation is in the Sohar region.  Oman&apos;s future economy is expected to depend on Sohar, which is growing very fast.  Since the slump in oil prices in 1998, Oman has made active plans to diversify its economy and is placing a greater emphasis on other areas of industry, such as tourism and natural gas.  This has also propelled Oman to undergo research into renewable forms of energy, such as wind, solar and hydroelectric.For Oman, industry is an extremely important part of their economy, it is not only one of the main sectors involved in diversifying the sources of national income and reducing dependence on oil; it is also capable of helping to meet Oman’s social development needs and generate greater added value for national resources by processing them into manufactured products.  Oman&apos;s mineral resources include chromite, dolomite, zinc, limestone, gypsum, silicon, copper, gold, cobalt and iron. Several industries have grown up around them as part of the national development process which, in turn, have boosted the minerals sector’s contribution to the nation’s GDP as well as providing jobs for Omanis.</string>

Pakistan has a 1,046-kilometre (650 mi) coastline along the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by the nations of India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest and China in the far northeast respectively. It is separated from Tajikistan by Afghanistan&apos;s narrow Wakhan Corridor in the north, and also shares a marine border with Oman.
The territory that now constitutes Pakistan was previously home to several ancient cultures, including the Mehrgarh of the Neolithic and the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilisation, and was later home to kingdoms ruled by people of different faiths and cultures, including Hindus, Indo-Greeks, Muslims, Turco-Mongols, Afghans and Sikhs. The area has been ruled by numerous empires and dynasties, including the Indian Mauryan Empire, the PersianAchaemenid Empire, Alexander of Macedonia, the Arab Umayyad Caliphate, the Mongol Empire, the Mughal Empire, the Durrani Empire, the Sikh Empire and the British Empire. As a result of the Pakistan Movement led byMuhammad Ali Jinnah and the subcontinent&apos;s struggle for independence, Pakistan was created in 1947 as an independent nation for Muslims from the regions in the east and west of Subcontinent where there was a Muslim majority. Initially a dominion, Pakistan adopted a new constitution in 1956, becoming an Islamic republic. A civil war in 1971 resulted in the secession of East Pakistan as the new country of Bangladesh.</string>

		<string>Pakistan&apos;s economy has been growing in the past years, and has shifted from being most agriculture based towards predominantly relying upon the service sector. Pakistan has courted foreign investment, especially in telecommunications, energy and real estate.

Although reliance upon agriculture has reduced in the country, it still makes up around two fifths of Pakistan&apos;s GDP. Agricultural produce includes wheat, rice, cotton, sugarcane, fruit and vegetables, milk, eggs, mutton and beef. The country has natural resources in gas, petrol, coal, iron ore, copper, salt and limestone. The main industries are textiles and clothes, food processing, pharmaceuticals, paper products, fertilisers, shrimp and construction materials. Pakistan&apos;s key trading partners are the US, the UK, the United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, Germany, Japan, China and Kuwait.</string>
		<key>tourism</key>
		<string>Tourism is an increasingly important sector for Pakistan&apos;s economy. Its rich cultural heritage, beautifully diverse landscapes and historic monuments attract growing numbers of visitors every year. Geographically diverse, Pakistan is home to K2, the world&apos;s tallest mountain, as well as many historical temples, fortresses and towers, picturesque gardens and parks and thriving towns and cities.</string>

		<string>Paraguay, officially the Republic of Paraguay is one of the only two landlocked countries in South America (along with Bolivia). It lies on both banks of the Paraguay River and is bordered by Argentina to the south and southwest, Brazil to the east and northeast, and Bolivia to the northwest. Because of its central location in South America, the country is sometimes referred to as Corazón de América — Heart of America.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>According to the CIA World Factbook, Paraguay has a population of 6,669,086; 95% of which are mestizo (mixed European and Amerindian) and 5% are &quot;other&quot;.  One trace of the original Guaraní culture that has endured is the Guaraní language, understood by 90% of the population. About 75% of all Paraguayans speak Spanish. Guarani and Spanish are official languages.  Small groups of ethnic Italians, Germans, Japanese, Koreans, Chinese, Arabs, Ukrainians, Brazilians, and Argentines settled in Paraguay, and they have to an extent retained their respective languages and culture, particularly the Brazilians who represent the largest number. 

Paraguay&apos;s population is distributed unevenly throughout the country. About 56% of Paraguayans live in urban areas. The vast majority of the people live in the eastern region near the capital and largest city, Asunción, that accounts for 10% of the country&apos;s population. The Gran Chaco region, which includes the Alto Paraguay, Boquerón and Presidente Hayes Department, and accounts for about 60% of the territory, is home to less than 2% of the population.</string>
		<key>environment</key>
		<string>Paraguay is divided by the Rio Paraguay into the eastern region, officially called Eastern Paraguay (Paraguay Oriental) and known as the Paraneña region; and the western region, officially called Western Paraguay (Paraguay Occidental) and also known as the Chaco.  The southeastern border is formed by the Paraná River, containing the Itaipu dam shared with Brazil. It is currently the largest hydroelectric power plant in the world, generating all the electricity required by Paraguay. Because Paraguay co-owns Itaipu Dam, they have the right to use 50% of electricity generated.  Because they use less than 10% of that electricity produced, they sell the rest back to Brazil. Another large hydroelectric power plant on the Paraná River is Yacyretá, shared by Paraguay and Argentina.  Paraguay is considered to be the only country in the world that produces 100% of its electricty needs from hydroelectricity.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Paraguay has a market economy marked by a large informal sector that features both re-export of imported consumer goods to neighboring countries, and thousands of small business enterprises. Paraguay&apos;s largest economic activity is based on agriculture, agribusiness and cattle ranching. Paraguay is ranked as the world&apos;s third largest exporter of chalk boards, and its beef exports are substantial for a country of its size.  Such perception may put Paraguay into the focus of international agro producers. Reuters India reports that &quot;Some of India&apos;s top vegetable oil firms plan to lease or buy land in Paraguay.  Paraguay allows foreign land ownership of any size. Only nationals of Brazil, Argentina and Bolivia can not own land in specific frontier regions. </string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>Although Paraguay is a very small country, there are a global giant in terms of renewable energy, being able to boast as the only country in the world that produces all of its electric needs by menas of hydroenergy.  Also Paraguay exports a tremendous amount of goods for such a small country.  As a country, Paraguay will look to further its growth by focusing on its strengths og agricultural production and hydroenergy power production.</string>

		<string>Peru is a country in western South America. It is bordered on the north by Ecuador and Colombia, on the east by Brazil, on the southeast by Bolivia, on the south by Chile, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean.  Peruvian territory was home to the Norte Chico civilization, one of the oldest in the world, and to the Inca Empire, the largest state in Pre-Columbian America. The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century and established a Viceroyalty, which included most of its South American colonies. Peru would however, gain their independence in 1821 and begin to establish their own unique culture.</string>
		<key>resources</key>
		<string>Peru has a vast abundance of natural resources and has begun research into expanding their renewable resource industry.  As a nation, Peru has been mainly focusing on wind energy, solar energy and hydroelectric energy.  Peru believes that these are the energy sources of the future and looks to incorporate them into their society</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Peru is a developing country, the country&apos;s economic performance has been tied to exports, which provide hard currency to finance imports and external debt payments, exports have provided substantial revenue.  Reforms have permitted sustained economic growth since 1993, as Peru looks to continue this trend in the future as well.</string>
		<key>culture</key>
		<string>Peruvian culture is primarily rooted in Amerindian and Spanish traditions, though it has also been influenced by various African, Asian, and European ethnic groups. Peruvian artistic traditions date back to the elaborate pottery, textiles, jewelry, and sculpture of Pre-Inca cultures. The Incas maintained these crafts and made architectural achievements including the construction of Machu Picchu. Baroque dominated colonial art, though modified by native traditions.  During this period, most art focused on religious subjects, the numerous churches of the era and the paintings of the Cuzco School are representative.</string>

		<string>The Philippines is an archipelago consisting of 7,107 islands in low tide and a bit less in high tide (as one of the famous Filipino joke boasts). There are three main regions: Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao that each boasts unique traditions, cultures, and culinary delights (that never cease to amaze even the pickiest business traveler). 
At the moment Manila, in the Luzon region, is the capital of the Philippines. Depending on who is in power, the government sometimes switches the capital to Quezon City (also in Luzon) as it is the largest city of the Philippines. Manila is the site of Malacañang Palace, the seat of government and official residence of the President. Financial, business, and posh shopping districts are found in Makati, also in the Luzon region. Quezon City is the home of the House of Congress, Camp Crame and Camp Aguinaldo (military bases), and other government buildings, such as the Social Security Building. 
The number of islands in the Philippines may give an indication of the number of dialects spoken; there are over 170 dialects spoken throughout the islands including Tagalog, Cebuano, Ilocano, Waray, etc. Interpreting the language may prove to be difficult as there are so many spoken dialects. However, the government officially declared Tagalog and English as the official languages of the country, making it appealing for Westerners to do business in the islands. 
Since English is the official language of the government, business and education, most Filipinos speak “Tag-lish”, a mixture of Tagalog and English words, in everyday conversation. This style of talking makes translating and interpreting a bit trickier as locals easily switch languages.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>With a GDP of approximately $299.6 billion, the Philippines is a newly industrialised country that has been named one of the &quot;Next Eleven&quot; due to its efforts to become a developed country by 2020, and the expansion of its economy. Its labour force is split between service and agriculture, and its industries include electronics, pharmaceuticals, food processing, petroleum refining and fishing. Major agricultural practices include the production of sugarcane, rice, coconuts, bananas, beef, fish and eggs. 
Although in the 1960s, the Philippines had the largest economy in Asia, it sustained a severe economic depression as its market economy was transposed into a centrally planned economy. By the 1990s, however, a period of economic liberalisation led to the upturn in the Philippines&apos; economic outlook.
The country is a founding member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and also a member of the World Bank, IMF, WTO and G-77.</string>
		<key>energy</key>
		<string>The Philippines is one of the sixteen nations to sign the Cebu Declaration on East Asian Energy Security. The purpose of this treaty was to promote sustainable alternatives for future energy sources, as well as to ensure energy security. The islands have an abundance of volcanic activity, and so the country is a world-leader in the provision of geothermal energy.</string>
		<key>resources</key>
		<string>The Philippines has an extremely diverse range of natural resources, from its extensive flora and fauna to areas such as agriculture, forestry and minerals. As an island nation its waters house a wealth of marine species, and its humid tropical climate attract orchids, pythons and birds of prey.</string>

		<string>Poland officially the Republic of Poland, is a country in Central Europe. Poland is bordered by Germany to the west; the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the south; Ukraine, Belarus and Lithuania to the east; and the Baltic Sea and Kaliningrad Oblast, a Russian exclave, to the north.

The establishment of a Polish state is often identified with the adoption of Christianity by its ruler Mieszko I, in 966, when the state covered territory similar to that of present-day Poland. In 1025, Poland became a kingdom and in 1569, it cemented a long association with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, by signing the Union of Lublin, forming the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Commonwealth collapsed in 1795 and Poland&apos;s territory was partitioned among Prussia, Russia and Austria. Poland regained its independence as the Second Polish Republic in 1918, after World War I, but lost it again in World War II, then occupied by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Poland lost over six million citizens in World War II, emerging several years later as the socialist People&apos;s Republic of Poland within the Eastern Bloc, under strong Soviet influence. During the Revolutions of 1989, communist rule was overthrown and Poland became what is constitutionally known as the &quot;Third Polish Republic&quot;. Poland is a unitary state, made up of sixteen voivodeships.  Poland is also a member of the European Union, NATO and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).</string>

		<key>about</key>
		<string>Portugal, officially the Portuguese Republic (Portuguese: República Portuguesa; Mirandese: República Pertuesa), is a country in southwest Europe. It is located on the Iberian Peninsula, and it is the westernmost country of mainland Europe, being bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west and south and by Spain to the north and east. Aside fromcontinental Portugal, the Portuguese Republic holds sovereignty over the Atlantic archipelagos of Azores and Madeira, which are autonomous regions of Portugal. The country is named after its second largest city, Porto, whose name derives from a combination of Latin &quot;Portus&quot;, and the Celtic place-name Cale.,
The land within the borders of the current Portuguese Republic has been continually fought over and settled since prehistoric times. The Celts and the Romans were followed by the Visigothic and the Suebi Germanic peoples, who were themselves later invaded by the Moors. These Muslim peoples were eventually expelled during the Christian Reconquista of the peninsula. By 1139, Portugal established itself as a kingdomindependent from León.[10] In the 15th and 16th centuries, as the result of pioneering the Age of Discovery, Portugal expanded western influence and established the first global empire,becoming one of the world&apos;s major economic, political and military powers.
The Portuguese Empire was the longest-lived of the modern European colonial empires, spanning almost 600 years, from the capture of Ceuta in 1415 to the handover of Macau to the People&apos;s Republic of China in 1999 (de facto) or the granting of sovereignty to East Timor in 2002 (de jure) after occupation by Indonesia since 1975. The empire spread throughout a vast number of territories that are now part of 53 different sovereign states, leaving a profound cultural and architectural influence across the globe with a legacy of over 250 million Portuguese speakers today (making it the sixth most spoken first language) and a number of Portuguese-based creoles. Portugal&apos;s international status was greatly reduced during the 19th century, especially following the Independence of Brazil. After the 1910 revolution deposed the monarchy, the democratic but unstablePortuguese First Republic was established, itself being superseded by the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; right-wing authoritarian regime. Democracy was restored after the Portuguese Colonial War and the Carnation Revolution in 1974. Shortly after, independence was granted to Angola, Mozambique, São Tomé and Príncipe, East Timor, Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>Portuguese is the official language of Portugal, and is a Romance language originally derived from Latin. In Portugal&apos;s period of colonial empire in the 16th century, the language spread worldwide, and for this reason Portuguese is now the official language in countries such as Brazil, Mozambique, East Timor and Angola. The language of Mirandese is recognised as a regional official language in some areas of the northeast of the country, and is spoken by some 5000 people.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Officially recognised as the 13th most globalised country in the world, Portugal was a founding member of the EU in 1960, as well as of the Euro in 1999. Surprisingly, it has the lowest GDP in Western Europe, at $236.967 billion (2008 est.), but despite this it has a stable and for some time a quickly growing and modernising economy. It is also a member of organisations such as NATO, OECD and the UN. 60% of Portugal&apos;s workers are employed in the service industry, for example in tourism. Industry employs 30% of workers,in trades for export such as textiles, footwear, paper, metals, oil refining, ship construction and aerospace development, as well as the country&apos;s famed Port wine. The country&apos;s imports include machinery, textiles and agricultural produce. The country has such natural resources as fish, forest, metal ores and hydropower, and its major trading partners are bordering Spain, France, Germany, US, UK and the Netherlands. Currently, the country&apos;s focus on high-tech industry means that Portugal exports more technology than it imports.
In 1985 Anibal Cavaco Silva was elected prime minister, heralding an era of free-market economic policy, however during the 90s the country voted in a Socialist government, and in 1999 Portugal became founding member of the European Economic and Monetary Union.</string>
		<key>science</key>
		<string>Much of Portugal&apos;s technological and scientific research takes place in Research and Development departments of universities and state-run institutions, with research centres dealing in the biosciences receiving worldwide renown, for example the Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular. The Lisbon Oceanarium is the largest aquarium in the world, one of many examples of the promotion of science and culture in the museums sector, for example elsewhere in the National Museum of Natural History and the Science Museum.Portugal has expanded a series of science parks across the country.</string>
		<key>energy</key>
		<string>Portugal is a key proponent of renewable and sustainable energy sources, as proved by its founding in 2001 the E4 Policy (Energy Efficiency and Endogenous Energies). As well as looking for sustainable options for future energy sources, and so helping to slow climate change by reducing gas emissions , the programme was also designed to increase Portugal&apos;s competitive status on the world economic stage. In the next ten years, the programme will focus on the supply and demand sides of energy efficiency, and the use of endogenous energy. Portugal currently uses such renewable energy sources as hydropower, wind power and geothermal energy.

		<string>Russia is a transcontinental country extending over much of northern Eurasia. It is a semi-presidential republic comprising 83 federal subjects. Russia shares land borders with the following countries, Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia and Democratic People&apos;s Republic of Korea. Russia is the largest country in the world, covering more than an eighth of the Earth’s land area; with 142 million people, it is the ninth largest by population.  It extends across the whole of northern Asia and 40% of Europe, spanning 11 time zones and incorporating a great range of environments and landforms.

The nation&apos;s history began with that of the East Slavs, which emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD.  Founded and ruled by a noble Viking warrior class and their descendants, the first East Slavic state, Kievan Rus&apos;, arose in the 9th century and adopted Christianity from the Byzantine Empire in 988, beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium.  Kievan Rus&apos; ultimately disintegrated and the lands were divided into many small feudal states. The most powerful successor state to Kievan Rus&apos; was Moscow, which served as the main force in the Russian reunification process and independence struggle against the Golden Horde. Moscow gradually reunified the surrounding Russian principalities and came to dominate the cultural and political legacy of Kievan Rus&apos;. By the 18th century, the nation had greatly expanded through conquest, annexation and exploration to become the Russian Empire, which was the third largest empire in history, stretching from Poland eastward to the Pacific Ocean and Alaska.

Russia established worldwide power and influence from the times of the Russian Empire to being the largest and leading constituent of the Soviet Union, the world&apos;s first and largest constitutionally socialist state and a recognized superpower. The nation can boast a long tradition of excellence in every aspect of the arts and sciences as well.  The Russian Federation was founded following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, but is recognized as the continuing legal personality of the Soviet Union, it also has one of the world&apos;s fastest growing major economies and has the world&apos;s eighth largest GDP.  It is one of the five recognized nuclear weapons states and possesses the world&apos;s largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction.  Russia is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a member of the G8, APEC and the SCO, and is a leading member of the Commonwealth of Independent States.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the economic depression faced in former soviet companies was severe. However, Russia&apos;s economy is now expanding again, backed by its vast supplies of natural gas, oil and coal reserves. It is the world&apos;s leading gas and oil exporter, and these fuels, combined with timber and metal, make up around 80% of Russia&apos;s global export.</string>
		<key>culture</key>
		<string>Classical Music and Ballet
Russia&apos;s large number of ethnic groups have distinctive traditions of folk music. Music in 19th century Russia was defined by the tension between classical composer Mikhail Glinka and his followers, who embraced Russian national identity and added religious and folk elements to their compositions, and the Russian Musical Society led by composers Anton and Nikolay Rubinstein, which was musically conservative. The later Romantic tradition of Tchaikovsky, one of the greatest composers of the Romantic era, whose music has come to be known and loved for its distinctly Russian character as well as its rich harmonies and stirring melodies, was brought into the 20th century by Sergei Rachmaninoff, one of the last great champions of the Romantic style of European classical music.  World-renowned composers of the 20th century included Scriabin, Stravinsky, Rachmaninoff, Prokofiev, and Shostakovich. During most of the Soviet Era, music was highly scrutinized and kept within a conservative, accessible idiom in conformity with the Stalinist policy of socialist realism. Russian conservatories have turned out generations of world-renowned soloists. Among the best known are violinists David Oistrakh and Gidon Kremer, cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, pianists Vladimir Horowitz, Sviatoslav Richter and Emil Gilels, and vocalist Galina Vishnevskaya.
Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky composed the world&apos;s most famous works of ballet, Swan Lake, The Nutcracker, and Sleeping Beauty. During the early 20th century, Russian dancers Anna Pavlova and Vaslav Nijinsky rose to fame, and impresario

Sergei Diaghilev and his Ballets Russes&apos; travels abroad profoundly influenced the development of dance worldwide.  Soviet ballet preserved the perfected 19th century traditions and the Soviet Union&apos;s choreography schools produced one internationally famous star after another, including Maya Plisetskaya, Rudolf Nureyev, and Mikhail Baryshnikov. The Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow and the Kirov in Saint Petersburg remain famous throughout the world.
Literature
Russian literature is considered to be among the most influential and developed in the world, contributing much of the world&apos;s most famous literary works.  Russia&apos;s literary history dates back to the 10th century and by the early 19th century a native tradition had emerged, producing some of the greatest writers of all time. This period and the Golden Age of Russian Poetry began with Alexander Pushkin, considered to be the founder of modern Russian literature and often described as the &quot;Russian Shakespeare&quot;.  Amongst Russia&apos;s most renowned poets and writers of the 19th century are Anton Chekhov, Mikhail Lermontov, Leo Tolstoy, Nikolai Gogol, Ivan Turgenev and Fyodor Dostoevsky. Ivan Goncharov, Mikhail Saltykov, Aleksey Pisemsky, and Nikolai Leskov made lasting contributions to Russian prose. Tolstoy and Dostoevsky in particular were titanic figures to the point that many literary critics have described one or the other as the greatest novelist ever.
Cinema
While in the industrialized nations of the West, motion pictures had first been accepted as a form of cheap recreation and leisure for the working class, Russian filmmaking came to prominence following the 1917 revolution when it explored editing as the primary mode of cinematic expression.  Russian and later Soviet cinema was a hotbed of invention in the period immediately following the 1917 revolution, resulting in world-renowned films such as Battleship Potemkin.  Soviet-era filmmakers, most notably Sergei Eisenstein and Andrei Tarkovsky, would become some of the world&apos;s most innovative and influential directors.
Sport
Russians have been successful at a number of sports and continuously finishing in the top rankings at the Olympic Games. During the Soviet era, the national team placed first in the total number of medals won at 14 of its 18 appearances; with these performances, the USSR was the dominant Olympic power of its era. Since the 1952 Olympic Games, Soviet and later Russian athletes have always been in the top three for the number of gold medals collected at the Summer Olympics. The 1980 Summer Olympic Games were held in Moscow while the 2014 Winter Olympics will be hosted by Sochi  .In 2007, Russia defeated world champions Spain to win Eurobasket 2007. Russian basketball clubs such as PBC CSKA Moscow (2006 and 2008 Euroleague Champions) have also had great success in European competitions such as the Euroleague and the ULEB Cup.

Soviet gymnasts, track-and-field athletes, weight lifters, wrestlers, cross country skiers, and boxers were consistently among the best in the world. Even since the collapse of the Soviet empire, Russian athletes have continued to dominate international competition in these areas. Although ice hockey was only introduced during the Soviet era, the national team soon dominated the sport internationally, winning gold at almost all the Olympics and World Championships they contested, most recently in the 2008 World Championships.

Figure skating is another popular sport; in the 1960s, the Soviet Union rose to become a dominant power in figure skating, especially in pair skating and ice dancing. At every Winter Olympics from 1964 until the present day, a Soviet or Russian pair has won gold, often considered the longest winning streak in modern sports history. Since the end of the Soviet era, tennis has grown in popularity and Russia has produced a number of famous tennis players. Chess is a widely popular pastime; from 1927, Soviet and Russian chess grandmasters have held the world championship almost continuously.</string>

		<key>about</key>
		<string>Rwanda, officially the Republic of Rwanda, is a sovereign state in central and east Africa. Located a few degrees south of theEquator, Rwanda is bordered by Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Rwanda is in the African Great Lakes region and is highly elevated; its geography dominated by mountains in the west and savanna to the east, with numerous lakes throughout the country. The climate of the country is temperate to subtropical, with two rainy seasons and two dry seasons each year.
The population is young and predominantly rural, with a density among the highest in Africa. Rwandans are composed of three ethnic groups: the Hutu, Tutsi and Twa. The Twa are a forest-dwelling pygmy people descended from Rwanda&apos;s earliest inhabitants. Scholars disagree on the origins of and differences between the Hutu and Tutsi; some believe differences are derived from former social castes, while others view them as being ethnicities or tribes. Christianity is the largest religion in the country; the principal language is Kinyarwanda, spoken by most Rwandans, with French and English serving as official languages. Rwanda has a presidential system of government. The president is Paul Kagame of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), who took office in 2000. Rwanda today has low corruption compared with neighbouring countries, although human rights organisations report suppression of opposition groups, intimidation and restrictions on freedom of speech. The country has been governed by a strict administrative hierarchy since precolonial times; there are five provinces delineated by borders drawn in 2006. Rwanda has the world&apos;s highest proportion of females in government positions in proportion to the population.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>Rwanda has three official languages - French, English and Kinyarwanda (or, in its simplified form; Rwanda), which is a Bantu language and mutually intelligible with Kirundi, spoken in Burundi.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Rwanda is the most densely populated country in Africa. The economy of Rwanda was devestated following the genocide of 1994. However, since then, the country has recovered to a certain extent, and its economy strengthened, thanks in great part to international aid. Rwanda has limited natural resources and instead is reliant upon subsistence agriculture, with produce such as coffee, tea, bananas, beans, potatoes and sorghum. There is also the breeding of livestock, and fishing is another sector which provides income to the country. Rwanda&apos;s manufacturing industry makes such products as drinks, cigarettes, wheelbarrows, soap, cement and textiles. Foreign investment in the country is focused upon tourism, mining, tea and coffee, and the country is focusing on expanding the revenue from the tourist industry.</string>
		<key>energy</key>
		<string>Charcoal from forests is a key source of fuel, but this is not a sustainable option due to the depletion of woodland areas. The terrain, with its mountains and lakes, lends itself perfectly to the harvesting of hydroelectric power, and Rwanda is working in this area to develop this source of sustainable and renewable energy, in partnership with Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</string>

		<string>Solomon Islands is a sovereign country consisting of a large number of islands in Oceania lying to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu and covering a land area of 28,400 square kilometres (11,000 sq mi). The country&apos;s capital, Honiara, is located on the island of Guadalcanal. Solomon Islands should not be confused with the Solomon Islands archipelago, which is a collection of Melanesian islands that includes Solomon Islands and Bougainville Island (part of Papua New Guinea), but excludes the nation&apos;s outlying islands, such as the Santa Cruz group.
The islands have been inhabited for thousands of years. In 1568, the Spanish navigator Álvaro de Mendaña was the first European to visit them, naming them the Islas Salomón. Britain defined its area of interest in the Solomon Islands archipelago in June 1893, when Captain Gibson R.N., of HMS Curacoa, declared the southern Solomon Islands as a British Protectorate with the proclamation of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate. During the Second World War, the Solomon Islands campaign (1942–1945) saw fierce fighting between the United States and the Empire of Japan, such as in the Battle of Guadalcanal.</string>

		<string>Senegal is a country in West Africa. It is the westernmost country in the mainland of theOld World or Eurafrasia and owes its name to the Sénégal River that borders it to the east and north. Senegal covers a land area of almost 197,000 square kilometres (76,000 sq mi), and has an estimated population of about 13 million. The climate is tropical with two seasons: the dry season and the rainy season.
Senegal&apos;s capital is Dakar. During the 17th and 18th centuries, numerous trading posts belonging to various European colonial empires were established along the coast. Senegal became a colony of France in the 19th century. It was granted independence from France in 1960.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>Although French is the official language of Senegal, there are many other languages and dialects spoken, including the recognised national language, Wolof, spoken by a high proportion of the population. Other languages include
Dyola, Fula, Pulaar, Guinea-Bissau Creole, Hassaniya Arabic, Karon, Mandinka, Maninka, Seereer-Siin, Serer, Soninke, Wolofal, Xaasongaxango, Yalunka.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Major industries in Senegal include cement, mining, food processing, fertiliser, textiles, refining imported petroleum, chemicals and tourisms. Main exports are fish, groundnuts, cotton, chemicals, calcium phosphate and fabrics, with important trading partners the US, UK, and Italy.

In 1994, Senegal started a programme of radical reform, with the help of the foreign aid community. After an initial decrease, the economy then started expanding, thanks to this system of reform, and now, Senegal&apos;s economy is increasing rapidly. Since the introduction of the internet to the country, there has been a surge in information technology, which has also helped to expand and develop the economy.

Senegal is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union, and so is working to integrate more at regional and international levels, as well as on reducing tariffs. Senegal is also a member of the Organization for the Harmonization of Businses Law in Africa.</string>
		<key>tourism</key>
		<string>Tourism is increasingly a vital part of the Senegalese economy, starting with visitors from former colonial France, and then expanding to attract visitors from around the world - with one million tourists visiting the country in 2008. Senegal boasts a variety of historic and cultural sites, as well as beach resorts and beautiful natural landscapes. Attractions include the former slave centre Goree Island, which is now a UNESCO World Heritage site, and Saint-Louis, a town visited for its colonial past and rich cultural heritage. The country also has several reserves including the World Heritage Site Niokolo-Koba National Park, which is home to an array of animals including hippopatomii, lions and elephants.</string>

		<string>Serbia, officially the Republic of Serbia, is a sovereign state situated at the crossroads between Central and Southeast Europe, covering the southern part of the Pannonian Plain and the central Balkans. Serbia is landlocked and borders Hungary to the north; Romania and Bulgaria to the east; Macedonia to the south; and Croatia, Bosnia, andMontenegro to the west; it also claims a border with Albania through the disputed territory of Kosovo. The capital of Serbia, Belgrade, is one of the largest cities in Southeast Europe. As of a 2011 census, Serbia (excluding Kosovo) had a total population of 7.2 million.
Following the Slavic migrations to the Balkans from the 6th century onwards, Serbs established several states in the early Middle Ages. The Serbian Kingdom obtained recognition by Rome and Constantinople in 1217; it reached its peak in 1346 as a relatively short-lived Serbian Empire. By the mid-16th century, the entire territory of modern-day Serbia was annexed by the Ottoman Empire, at times interrupted by the Habsburgs. In the early 19th century, the Serbian Revolution established the nation-state as the region&apos;s first constitutional monarchy, which subsequently expanded its territory. Following disastrous casualties in World War I, and subsequent unification of Habsburg crownland of Vojvodina with Serbia, the country co-founded Yugoslavia with other South Slavic peoples, which would exist in various formations until the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, which had devastating effects for the region. As a result, Serbia formed a union with Montenegro in 1992, which broke apart in 2006, when Serbia again became an independent country. In 2008 the parliament of Kosovo, Serbia&apos;s southern province with an Albanian ethnic majority, declared independence, with mixed responses from the international community.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>Standard Serbian is based on the Shtokavian dialect, and is mutually intelligible with Croatian and Bosnian. Its alphabet is a variety of the Cyrillic alphabet, and for many Western European speakers, it makes up (with Croatian, Montenegrin and Bosnian) just one language - Serbo-Croatian.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>After the break-up of Yugoslavia, Serbia became an independent country in 2006 and is a member of OSCE, the UN, the Council of Europe. It is a potential member of the EU. Its GDP is approximately $80 billion, and so is referred to by the World Bank as an upper-middle income country. After the ousting of Milosovic in 2000, the country has undergone significant economic growth, leading it to be referred to as a tiger economy. With favourable economic agreements with both the East and West, Serbia hopes to become an export-oriented economy. Its workforce is split roughly equally between the service, industry and agriculture sectors, with tourism being a chief source of income, as well as industries including sugar, machinery, transport and communication technology, which make up its chief exports. Serbia is the world&apos;s main frozen fruit exporter, and grows roughly a third of the world&apos;s raspberries.Serbia is often seen as a bridge between east and west, and is proud of its boast of the oldest airline carriers, founded in 1927. The country has 3 international airports, as well as rail links, and many European routes pass through the country. The Danube River runs through Serbia, and connects the country to the North Sea. 89% of households have telephones while 33% use the internet - a fact which places Serbia ahead of other European countries.</string>

		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Thanks to the tourism sector, which plays a vital role in bringing in foreign income to the Seychelles, the country&apos;s economy has grown rapidly in the past years. However, the government is now trying to minimise dependance on the tourist industry by expanding areas such as fishing, farming, and small-scale manufacturing. The government is also involved in widespread privatisation of services and industries. Industrial fishing, especially of tuna, is vital to the economy, and the Seychelles&apos; main Tuna Canning Factory was taken over by Heinz and privatised. Although the Seychelles imports almost all of its food, exceptions include fruit, vegetables, fish, beer, poultry and pork. The country&apos;s main trading partners are the UK, Germany, France, Spain, Japan and Italy.</string>
		<key>geography</key>
		<string>The Seychelles has an extremely beautiful and diverse landscape, with a wealth of marine wildlife and many protected species.

Seychelles hosts some of the largest colonies of seabirds in the whole world as well as many giant tortoises.</string>
		<key>resources</key>
		<string>The Seychelles is completely reliant on fossil fuels for its energy source, and has also found large offshore gas and oil reserves which it is looking to harvest.

		<string>Saudi Arabia, officially known as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, is the largest Arab state in Western Asia by land area (approximately 2,150,000 km2 (830,000 sq mi)), constituting the bulk of the Arabian Peninsula, and the second-largest geographically in the Arab world. It is bordered by Jordan and Iraq to the north, Kuwait to the northeast, Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates to the east, Oman to the southeast, and Yemen in the south. It is the only nation with both a Red Sea coast and a Persian Gulf coast and much of its terrain consists of inhospitable desert.
The area of modern-day Saudi Arabia formerly consisted of four distinct regions: Hejaz, Najd and parts of Eastern Arabia (Al-Ahsa) and Southern Arabia (&apos;Asir). The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932 by Ibn Saud. He united the four regions into a single state through a series of conquests beginning in 1902 with the capture of Riyadh, the ancestral home of his family, the House of Saud. The country has since been an absolute monarchy governed along Islamic lines. Wahhabi Islam has been called &quot;the predominant feature of Saudi culture&quot;. Saudi Arabia is sometimes called &quot;the Land of the Two Holy Mosques&quot; in reference to Al-Masjid al-Haram (in Mecca), and Al-Masjid an-Nabawi (in Medina), the two holiest places in Islam. The Kingdom has a total population of 28.7 million, of which 20 million are Saudi nationals and 8 million foreigners.
Saudi Arabia is the world&apos;s second largest oil producer and largest exporter, and controls the world&apos;s second largest hydrocarbon reserves. Backed by its fossil fuels, the kingdom is categorized as a high income economy with a high Human Development Index (HDI), and is the only Arab country to be part of the G-20 major economies. However, Saudi Arabia has the least diversified economy in the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC). It is ruled by an authoritarian regime and is ranked as &quot;Not Free&quot; by Freedom House. Saudi Arabia has the fourth highest military expenditure in the world, and in 2010-14, SIPRIfound that Saudi Arabia was the world&apos;s second largest arms importer. Saudi Arabia is considered a regional and middle power. In addition to the GCC, it is an active member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperationand OPEC.</string>

		<string>Singapore is a modern city-state and island country in Southeast Asia. It lies off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula and is 137 kilometres (85 mi) north of the equator. The country&apos;s territory consists of the diamond-shaped main island, commonly referred to as Singapore Island in English and Pulau Ujong in Malay, and more than 60 significantly smaller islets.Singapore is separated from Peninsular Malaysia by the Straits of Johor to the north, and from Indonesia&apos;s Riau Islands by the Singapore Strait to the south. The country is highly urbanised, and little of the original vegetation remains. The country&apos;s territory has consistently expanded through land reclamation.
The islands were settled in the second century AD and subsequently belonged to a series of local empires. Modern Singapore was founded in 1819 by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles as a trading post of the East India Company with permission from the Johor Sultanate. The British obtained sovereignty over the island in 1824, and Singapore became one of the British Straits Settlements in 1826. Occupied by the Japanese during World War II, Singapore became independent from the United Kingdom in 1963 and united with other former British territories to form Malaysia, from which it was expelled two years later through a unanimous act of parliament. Singapore has since developed rapidly, earning recognition as one of the Four Asian Tigers.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>The official languages of Singapore are English, Malay, Chinese and Tamil. English is used in general conversation and in business, while Malay is the country&apos;s national language. There is also a patois spoken on the streets, known as Singlish but by linguists as Singapore Colloquial English. Other languages spoken are Bengali, Mandarin and Hakka, Gujarati, Javanese, Madura, Malaccan Creole Portuguese, Malayalam, Orang Seletar, Panjabi and Sinhala.</string>

		<string>Slovakia is a country in Central Europe. Slovakia is bordered by the Czech Republic and Austria to the west, Poland to the north, Ukraine to the east and Hungaryto the south. The largest city is the capital, Bratislava. Slovakia is a member of the European Union, Eurozone, Schengen Area, NATO, the United Nations, the OECD and the WTO. The official language is Slovak, a member of the Slavic language family.
The Slavs arrived in the territory of present-day Slovakia in the 5th and 6th centuries. In the 7th century, they played a significant role in the creation of Samo&apos;s Empire and in the 9th century established the Principality of Nitra. In the 10th century, the territory of today&apos;s Slovakia was integrated into the Kingdom of Hungary, which itself became part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire or Habsburg Empire. After World War I and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Slovaks and Czechs established Czechoslovakia. A separate Slovak Republic (1939–1945) existed in World War II as a client state of Nazi Germany. In 1945, Czechoslovakia was reestablished. Slovakia became an independent state on 1 January 1993 after the peaceful dissolution of Czechoslovakia.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>Slovak, the official language of Slovakia, is an Indo-European language which is very similar to Czech, and has also been influenced in its formation by other Slavic languages such as Polish and German. It is spoken by 5 million people in Slovakia, as well as in countries including the US, Czech Republic, Serbia, Ireland, Romania, Hungary, Poland and Canada. Slovak uses a variation of the Latin alphabet, which includes 4 added diacriticals (accents) placed above particular letters. Many dialects are intelligible to both Czech and standard Slovak, but Eastern Slovak dialects differ in structure and so are closer to the Rusyn language.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Slovakia has been referred to as a tiger economy - specifically as the Tatra Tiger - meaning it has gone through a period of sustained and very fast economic development which has then been accompanied by an increase in standard of living, and so has the fastest growth rate in the EU and OECD. Since independence it has moved from a centrally run economy to a thriving market economy, and now has a GDP of $109.6 billion (as of 2007.) Privatisation is almost uniform in the country, for example the banking sector which is almost entirely under private control. It is a member of organisations including the EU, NATO, UN, OECD, WTO and UNESCO.
The labour force is split between majorities in the industry and service sectors, and exports include vehicles, machinery equipment, base metals, chemicals and plastics. Car manufacture in particular is a key industry, with companies Volkswagon, Kia and Citroen all having bases in the country. Slovenia is popular with foreign investors because of its low tax rates and labour costs, and consequently in recent years it has developed a programme for encouraging foreign investment. At the end of 2008, Slovakia went from being an Aid Receiver from the World Bank to being an Aid Provider.A key research centre in Slovakia is the Slovak Academy of Sciences, which is currently specialising in research in nature, society and technology. It is affiliated with 41 scientific and ancillary institutes. Also important in Slovakian research is the Institute of Political Science, which is part of the SAS, and specialises in international relations as well as domestic politics. Slovak inventions include the wireless telegraph, the first parachute and the steam and gas turbine, as well as the creation of the first electric motor and generator.  Slovak Ivan Bella went to space as part of the Russian-French-Slovak mission on the Mir space station in 1999.</string>

		<string>Slovenia is a nation state on the Adriatic Sea, bordering Italy to the west, Austria to the north, Croatia to the south and southeast, and Hungary to the northeast. It is a parliamentary republic and a member of the European Union and NATO.Its capital and largest city is Ljubljana.
The territory, located in southern Central Europe at the crossroads of main European cultural and trade routes, is mainly mountainous with mainly continental climate, with the exception of theSlovene Littoral that has the sub-Mediterranean climate and the north-western area that has the Alpine climate. Additionally, the Dinaric Alps and the Pannonian Plain meet on the territory of Slovenia. The country, marked by a significant biological diversity, is one of the most water-rich in Europe, with a dense river network, a rich aquifer system, and significant karst underground watercourses. Over half of the territory is covered by forest. The human settlement of Slovenia is dispersed and uneven.
The Slavic, Germanic, Romance, and Hungarian languages meet here. Although the population is not homogeneous, the majority is Slovene. Slovene is the only official language throughout the country, whereas Italian and Hungarian are regional minority languages. Slovenia is a largely secularized country, but its culture and identity have been significantly influenced by Catholicism as well as Lutheranism. Theeconomy of Slovenia is small, open, and export-oriented and has been strongly influenced by international conditions. It has been severely hurt by the Eurozone crisis, started in the late 2000s. The main economic field is services, followed by industry and construction.
Historically, the current territory of Slovenia was part of many different state formations, including the Roman Empire and the Holy Roman Empire, followed by the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In October 1918, the Slovenes exercised self-determination for the first time by co-founding the internationally unrecognized State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, which merged that December with the Kingdom of Serbia into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (renamed Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929). During World War II, Slovenia was occupied and annexed by Germany, Italy, Croatia, and Hungary. Afterward, it was a founding member of the Federal People&apos;s Republic of Yugoslavia, later renamed the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In June 1991, after the introduction of multi-party representative democracy, Slovenia split from Yugoslavia and became an independent country. In 2004, it entered NATO and the European Union; in 2007 became the first former Communist country to join the Eurozone; and in 2010 joined the OECD, a global association of high-income developed countries.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>Slovene is the official language of Slovenia, which evolved from dialects in the 18th century. Older dialects still exist in areas of the country, but these are in decline, and the official Slovene written and spoken language is standardised.

		<string>A member of such bodies as NATO, the EU, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, Slovenia has the relatively high GDP of $54.67 billion, and is a developed country in Eastern Europe. The labour force is divided between the service and industry sectors, for example in areas such as metal production and smelting, electronics and power equipment, wood products, textiles and chemicals, of which many make up the country&apos;s $18 million exports. The country&apos;s major trading partners include Germany, Italy, Austria, France, Croatia and Bosnia. Tourism is an increasingly important industry.
After gaining independence from Yugoslavia, in the 1990s, the country saw privatisations in banking, telecommunications and public utilities, and in January 2008 became the first ever former Communist country to gain EU presidency.
Since its 1991independence, the country has been focused upon improving communication and diplomacy with neighbouring countries, as well as improving its own infrastructure, and since 1997 it has contributed to a UN peacekeeping operation.</string>

		<key>about</key>
		<string>Somalia is a country located in the Horn of Africa. It is bordered by Ethiopia to the west, Djibouti to the northwest, the Gulf of Aden to the north, the Indian Ocean to the east, and Kenya to the southwest. Somalia has the longest coastline on the continent&apos;s mainland,and its terrain consists mainly of plateaus, plains and highlands. Climatically, hot conditions prevail year-round, with periodic monsoon winds and irregular rainfall.
Somalia has a population of around 10 million. Around 85% of residents are ethnic Somalis, who have historically inhabited the northern part of the country. Ethnic minorities make up the remainder and are largely concentrated in the southern regions. The official languages of Somalia are Somali and Arabic, both of which belong to the Afro-Asiatic family.Most people in the country are Muslim, with the majority being Sunni.
In antiquity, Somalia was an important commercial centre,and is among the most probable locations of the fabled ancient Land of Punt.During the Middle Ages, several powerful Somali empires dominated the regional trade, including the Ajuran Empire, the Adal Sultanate, the Warsangali Sultanate, and the Geledi Sultanate. In the late 19th century, through a succession of treaties with these kingdoms, the British and Italians gained control of parts of the coast and established the colonies of British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland. In the interior, Muhammad Abdullah Hassan&apos;s Dervish State successfully repelled the British Empire four times and forced it to retreat to the coastal region. The Dervishes were finally defeated in 1920 by British airpower. Italy acquired full control of the northeastern and southern parts of the area after successfully waging the so-called Campaign of the Sultanates against the ruling Majeerteen Sultanate and Sultanate of Hobyo. Italian occupation lasted until 1941, yielding to British military administration. Northern Somalia would remain a protectorate, while southern Somalia became a United Nations Trusteeship in 1949. In 1960, the two regions united to form the independent Somali Republic under a civilian government. Mohamed Siad Barre seized power in 1969 and established the Somali Democratic Republic. In 1991, Barre&apos;s government collapsed as the Somali Civil War broke out.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>English and Arabic are widely taught as well as spoken in Somalia, but the language of Somali is the country&apos;s national language and is spoken by much of the population. Other languages include Boni, Boon, Dabarre, English, Garre, Jiiddu, Maay, Mushungulu, Oromo, Swahili and Tunni.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Somalia&apos;s economy is relatively prosperous compared with other African states, and has moved from being centrally governed to being a strong market economy. Agriculture is the main sector of the economy, with agricultural produce including bananas, sorghum, corn, rice, coconuts, sugarcane, sesame seeds, mangoes, beans, cattle, goats, fish and sheep. Main industries in Somalia are light manufacturing such as sugar refining, textiles and wireless communication. The country&apos;s major trading partners are UAE, Yemen, Oman, Djibouti, India, Brazil and Kenya. Somalia&apos;s limited natural resources are uranium, unexploited reserves of iron ore, gypsum, bauxite, tin, copper, salt and natural gas.</string>
		<key>energy</key>
		<string>Somalia relies on fossil fuels for all of its energy production, and although it does not have any oil reserves, there is the possibility of extracting oil from Puntland. However, the country cannot continue to use only unsustainable energy sources, and in the future it must look for more environmental and long-term alternative power supplies.</string>

		<string>Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden, is a Nordic country on the Scandinavian Peninsula in Northern Europe. Sweden has land borders with Norway to the west and Finland to the northeast, and it is connected to Denmark by the Öresund Bridge in the south.  Sweden is the third largest country in the European Union in terms of area, and it has a total population of over 9.2 million. Sweden has a low population density of 20 people per km² (52 per square mile), but is much higher in the southern half of the country. About 85% of the population live in urban areas.  Sweden is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of government and a highly developed economy. It ranks first in the world in The Economist&apos;s Democracy Index and 7th in the United Nation&apos;s Human Development Index. Sweden has been a member of the European Union since 1 January 1995.</string>
		<key>climate</key>
		<string>Most of Sweden has a temperate climate, despite its northern latitude, with four distinct seasons and mild temperatures throughout the year. The country can be divided into three types of climate; the southernmost part has an oceanic climate, the central part has a humid continental climate and the northernmost part has a subarctic climate.  Sweden has a very diverse climate, in late June there can be up to 18 hours of daylight, where as in December less than 6.  The global climate changes are also making this weather more extreme, in some cases for periods in the north, during the winter the sun may not even rise at all.  Sweden realises how serious these problems are and has taken the initiative towards research and studies to combat these global changes.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Sweden is an export-oriented market economy featuring a modern distribution system, excellent internal and external communications, and a skilled labour force. Timber, hydropower, and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Sweden&apos;s engineering sector accounts for 50% of output and exports. Telecommunications, the automotive industry and the pharmaceutical industries are also of great importance. Agriculture accounts for 2 percent of GDP and employment.  The 20 largest companies registered in Sweden are Volvo, Ericsson, Vattenfall, Skanska, Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB, Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget, Electrolux, Volvo Personvagnar, TeliaSonera, Sandvik, Scania, ICA, Hennes &amp; Mauritz, Nordea, Preem, Atlas Copco, Securitas, Nordstjernan, and SKF.  Sweden&apos;s industry is overwhelmingly in private control; unlike some other industrialized Western countries, such as Austria and Italy, publicly owned enterprises were always of minor importance.</string>
		<key>energy</key>
		<string>Sweden&apos;s energy market is largely privatized. The Nordic energy market is one of the first liberalized energy markets in Europe and it&apos;s traded in Nord Pool. In 2006, out of a total electricity production of 139 TWh, electricity from hydropower accounted for 61 TWh (44%), and nuclear power delivered 65 TWh (47%). At the same time, the use of biofuels, peat etc. produced 13 TWh (9%) of electricity, while wind power produced 1 TWh (1%). Sweden was a net importer of electricity by a margin of 6 TWh.  Biomass is mainly used to produce heat for district heating and central heating and industry processes.On the other hand, Sweden has proposed ban gasoline fossil fuel-driven vehicles by 2025.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>The primary language of Sweden is Swedish, a North Germanic language, related and very similar to Danish and Norwegian, but differing in pronunciation and orthography. Norwegians have little difficulty understanding Swedish, and Danes can also understand it, with slightly more difficulty than the Norwegians.  Although Swedish is the dominant language, it is not an official language. Sweden Finns are Sweden&apos;s largest linguistic minority, comprising about 3 percent of Sweden&apos;s population and Finnish is recognised as a minority language. Four other minority languages are also recognised (Meänkieli, Sami, Romani and Yiddish). The issue of whether Swedish should be declared the official language has been raised and the parliament voted on the matter in 2005 but the proposal narrowly failed.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>Sweden will continue to grow because of the strength of its telecommunications industry as well as the strength of its renewable energy market industry.  They will continue to be the number one provider for cellular communications and look to expand their economy even further to be a dominant power in the European market.

		<string>Switzerland is a federal parliamentary republic consisting of 26 cantons, with Bern as the seat of the federal authorities, the so-called Bundesstadt (&quot;federal city&quot;).The country is situated in Western and Central Europe, where it is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is alandlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of 41,285 km2 (15,940 sq mi). While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately 8 million people is concentrated mostly on the Plateau, where the largest cities are to be found; among them are the two global and economic centres of Zürich and Geneva.
The establishment of the Swiss Confederation is traditionally dated to 1 August 1291, which is celebrated annually as Swiss National Day. The country has a long history of armed neutrality—it has not been in a state of war internationally since 1815—and did not join the United Nations until 2002. Nevertheless it pursues an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in peace-building processes around the world. In addition to being the birthplace of the Red Cross, Switzerland is home to numerous international organizations, including the second largest UN office. On the European level, it is a founding member of the European Free Trade Association and is part of the Schengen Area – although it is notably not a member of the European Union, nor the European Economic Area (and thus does not use the Eurocurrency).</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>The linguistic geography of Switzerland is in three parts, with the Swiss German region in the northeast, the Swiss French part in the west and the Swiss Italian area to the south. There is also a small population of Romansh speakers. These four languages make up the official languages of Switzerland.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Switzerland has a stable and well developed capitalist economy, with a high GDP - it is ranked as the second most competitive economy in the world. Switzerland houses a number of large corporations, including Nestle, Credit Suisse, Zurich Financial Services and Adecco. Important industries in Switzerland are pharmaceuticals, musical instruments, real estate, tourism, chemicals and electronics. Unemployment in Switzerland is extremely low. Switzerland is a member of the OECD, and EFTA., but, controversially, has not joined the EU, despite bringing many of its economic policies in line with EU legislature. In late 2008, Switzerland joined the Schengen passport-free zone.</string>
		<key>energy</key>
		<string>Switzerland&apos;s energy sources are mostly split between hydroelectricity and nuclear power, resulting in an almost completely CO2 free electricity network. There are plans in place for more nuclear power stations to be built in the country. The Swiss Federal Office of Energy is responsible for issues relating to energy production within the Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communication, and it supports the plans to cut the nation&apos;s energy use by a half by 2050. Switzerland is one of the top recycling countries in the world.</string>
		<key>science</key>
		<string>Switzerland is a leading nation for scientific and technological research, and there have been several Nobel prizewinners born and bred in the country, most famously Albert Einstein, who developed his theory of relativity while working in Bern.

		<string>Syria is a country in Western Asia, bordering Lebanon and the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Turkey to the north,Iraq to the east, Jordan to the south, and Israel to the southwest. Its capital Damascus is among the oldest continuously-inhabited cities in the world. A country of fertile plains, high mountains, and deserts, it is home to diverse ethnic and religious groups, including Arabs, Greeks, Armenians, Assyrians, Kurds, Circassians, Mhallami, Mandeans and Turks. Religious groups include Sunni, Christians, Alawite, Druze religion,Mandeanism and Yezidi. Sunni Arabs make up the largest population group in Syria.
In English, the name &quot;Syria&quot; was formerly synonymous with the Levant (known in Arabic as al-Sham) while the modern state encompasses the sites of several ancient kingdoms and empires, including the Eblancivilization of the 3rd millennium BC. In the Islamic era, Damascus was the seat of the Umayyad Caliphate and a provincial capital of the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt.
The modern Syrian state was established after World War I as a French mandate, and represented the largest Arab state to emerge from the formerly Ottoman-ruled Arab Levant. It gained independence in April 1946, as a parliamentary republic. The post-independence period was tumultuous, and a large number of military coups and coup attempts shook the country in the period 1949–1971. Between 1958-61, Syria entered a briefunion with Egypt, which was terminated by a military coup. The Arab Republic of Syria came into being in 1963, transforming from the Republic of Syria in the Ba&apos;athist coup d&apos;état. Syria was under Emergency Law from 1963 to 2011, effectively suspending most constitutional protections for citizens, and its system of government is considered to be non-democratic. Bashar al-Assad has been president since 2000 and was preceded by his father Hafez al-Assad, who was in office from 1970 to 2000.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>The most widely spoken language in Syria is Arabic, which is also the country&apos;s official language. English and French are also spoken by the educated proportion of the population. Other languages spoken include Armenian, Turkmen, Aramaic, Turoyo, Assyrian Neo-Aramaic and Western Neo-Aramaic.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Syria&apos;s economy is middle-income, and is based on agriculture, industry, tourism and oil. Agricultural produce includes barley, cotton, wheat, lentils, chickpeas, olives, sugar beets, mutton, beef, eggs, milk and poultry. Petroleum, textiles, beverages, food processing, tobacco and phosphate rock mining are the country&apos;s main industries. Syria&apos;s natural resources are phosphates, petroleum, chrome, manganese ores, asphalt, iron ore, rock, salt, marble, gypsum and hydropower. Syria&apos;s main trading partners are Italy, France, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, China, Ukraine, Russia, South Korea and the US.

Syria put in a request to join the World Trade Organization in 2001. The country also has a free trade agreement with Turkey, and has put forward an Association Agreement with the EU.</string>

		<string>Ukraine is a country in Eastern Europe. It has an area of 603,628 km2 (233,062 sq mi), making it the largest country entirely within Europe. Ukraine borders Russia to the east and northeast, Belarus to the northwest, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary to the west, Romania and Moldova to the southwest, and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast, respectively.
The territory of modern Ukraine has been inhabited by humans since 32,000 BC. During the Middle Ages, the area was a key center of East Slavic culture, with the powerful state of Kievan Rus&apos; forming the basis of Ukrainian identity. Following its fragmentation in the 13th century, the territory was contested, ruled and divided by a variety of powers, including Lithuania, Poland, the Ottoman Empire, Austro-Hungary, and Russia. ACossack republic emerged and prospered during the 17th and 18th centuries, but Ukraine&apos;s territories remained divided until they were consolidated into a Soviet republic in the 20th century. It became independent in 1991.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>Russian, the language of the Soviet Union is still widely spoken in Ukraine; however, Ukrainian is the official language. Most Ukrainian speakers speak Russian as a second language. During the Soviet era,  speakers of  Ukrainian were in a constant decline, however since independence from the Eastern bloc, the government implemented a policy of Ukrainisation, and the language experienced a resurgence.

The language is part of an East Slavic subgroup, and shares vocabulary with the languages of bordering countries, in particular Polish, Slovak and Russian. There are several existing modern dialects of Ukrainian, including Polissian, Steppe, Slobodan, Lemko and Hutsul, as well as the Rusyn language.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine  has gone from a planned to market economy, which caused a severe contraction and plummeted much of the population into poverty. However, in 1991 government reforms led to a solution to the problem through liberalisation, but at the same time subsidised government-owned industries - such conflict in economic policy led to hyperinflation, but prices stabilised after the introduction of the new currency, the hryvnia, in 1996. In the early 2000s the economy started to grow and show promise, with its 2007 GDP estimated at $359 billion. With a labour force divided roughly equally between service, industry and agriculture sectors, Ukraine specialises in the exportation of vehicles and spacecraft - since independence, the Ukraine has kept its own Space Agency (NSAU), and became a leading country in scientific space exploration, as well as missile technology.The World Bank refers to Ukraine as a middle income country, due in part to its underdeveloped infrastructure and transportation. However, growing sectors in the country include IT, which in 2007 grew by 40%.</string>
		<key>energy</key>
		<string>Ukraine is, for the most part, reliant upon Russia for its energy sources, importing oil and natural gas, and as a country is one of the Europe&apos;s biggest energy consumers. The country receives a lot of nuclear fuel from Russia, and is, in general, heavily reliant on that source of energy. However, as yet, there has been little headway made in moving towards more renewable and greener sources of energy - for instance in 2005, energy sources were divided between nuclear (47%), thermal (45%) and hydro (8%).</string>

		<string>Uruguay is a country located in the southeastern part of South America. It is home to 3.46 million people, of whom 1.7 million live in the capital Montevideo and its metropolitan area.  Uruguay&apos;s only land border is with Brazil to the north. To the west lies the Uruguay River, to the southwest lies the estuary of Río de la Plata, with Argentina only a short commute across the banks of either of these bodies of water, while to the southeast lies the South Atlantic Ocean. Uruguay is the second smallest country in South America, larger only than Suriname.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Uruguay economy relies heavily on trade, particularly in agricultural exports, Uruguay&apos;s financial indicators  have remained more stable than those of its neighbours, a reflection of its solid reputation among investors and its investment-grade sovereign bond rating—one of only two in South America.  In recent years Uruguay has shifted some of its energy into developing the commercial use of technologies and has become the first exporter of software in Latin America.</string>
		<key>climate</key>
		<string>The climate in Uruguay is temperate, it has warm summers and cool winters. The predominantly gently undulating landscape is somewhat vulnerable to rapid changes from weather fronts. It receives the periodic influence of the polar air in winter, and tropical air from Brazil in summer. Without mountains to act as a barrier, the air masses freely move by the territory, causing abrupt weather changes.  These changes have been particulary intense recently due to the effects of global warming and climate change.  This has promted Uruguay to embark on studies and research to better understand and control climate change issues and global warming issues.</string>
		<key>agriculture</key>
		<string>Agriculture played such an important part in Uruguayan history and national identity until the middle of the twentieth century that the entire country was sometimes likened to a single huge estancia (agricultural estate) centered around Montevideo, where the wealth generated in the hinterland was spent, at its casco or administrative head.  Today, agriculture contributes roughly 11% to the country’s GDP and is still the main foreign exchange earner, putting Uruguay in line with other agricultural exporters like Brazil, Canada, and New Zealand. Uruguay is also a member of the Cairns Group of exporters of agricultural products.  Industry has developed recently around estancia tourism which capitalizes on the traditional or folkloric connotations associated with gaucho culture and the remaining resources of Uruguay&apos;s historic estancias.</string>
		<key>culture</key>
		<string>Uruguay has an impressive legacy of artistic and literary traditions, especially considering its small size. The contribution of its alternating conquerors and diverse immigrants has resulted in native traditions that integrate this diversity. Uruguay has centuries old remains, fortresses of the colonial era. Its cities have a rich architectural heritage and an impressive number of writers, artists, and musicians.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>In the near future, Uruguay will look to expand based on its tremendous agricultural wealth and abundance of natural resources.  Also, Uruguay has become a leader in South America in terms of scientific research, especially related to global warming and climate change.  Aside from this research Uruguay will also look to expand its scientific research of stem-cells and other helath related issues.</string>

		<string>Uganda, or the Republic of Uganda is a land-locked country in Africa. It is bordered on the east by Kenya, on the north by Sudan, on the west by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the southwest by Rwanda, and on the south by Tanzania. The southern part of the country includes a substantial portion of Lake Victoria, within which it shares borders with Kenya and Tanzania.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>The nation of Uganda has a vast amount of natural resources that include fertile soils, regular rainfall, and sizable mineral deposits of copper and cobalt. The country has largely untapped reserves of both crude oil and natural gas. Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy, employing over 80% of the work force, with coffee accounting for the bulk of export revenues. The booming agricultural industry of Uganda has been growing since the mid 80&apos;s and continues to grow over current expectations. Government reforms and new policies have allowed this to happen as well as foreign direct investment.</string>
		<key>climate</key>
		<string>Most of Uganda is very near to the Equator, which allows for these extreme weather changes due to global warming and climate change. Southern Uganda is wetter with rain generally spread throughout the year. There has been much research to better understand and possibly control global warming and climate change, but the negative effects have been severe so far, research has showed that it prevents temperatures from varying significantly and increases cloudiness and rainfall. Uganda is working closely with other African nations to conduct joint studies that will benefit all of Africa in order to overcome these terrible changes that global warming has taken part on them</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>Uganda will look to continue to grow and expand its economy in the years to come. As in the past, Uganda will focus on its vast wealth of natural resources and agricultural industry in order to become an African leader in terms of industry exportation. Also Uganda will be able to boast that it has the largest percentage of agricultural workforce in all of Africa, with nearly 80%. This will be an important factor in the future as Uganda looks to continue its expanding agricultural industry.</string>

		<string>The United States of America (commonly referred to as the United States, the U.S., the USA, or America) is a federal constitutional republic comprising fifty states and a federal district. The country is situated mostly in central North America, where its forty-eight contiguous states and Washington, D.C., the capital district, lie between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, bordered by Canada to the north and Mexico to the south. The state of Alaska is in the northwest of the continent, with Canada to its east and Russia to the west across the Bering Strait. The state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The country also possesses several territories, or insular areas, in the Caribbean and Pacific.  With about 306 million people, the United States is the third or fourth largest country by total area, and third largest by land area and by population. The United States is one of the world&apos;s most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries.  The U.S. economy is the largest national economy in the world, with nearly 25% of the GDP of the entire world.  The United States is also by far the wealthiest country in the world.

Originally a colony of Great Britain, the United States - known then as the 13 Colonies - declared their independence on July 4th, 1776 with The Declaration of Independence.  They would eventually win the American Revolution against Great Britain, itself the first successful colonial war of independence. </string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>The United States has a capitalist mixed economy, which is fueled by abundant natural resources, a well-developed infrastructure, and high productivity.  The United States is the largest importer of goods and third largest exporter, though exports per capita are relatively low. Canada, China, Mexico, Japan, and Germany are its top trading partners.  The leading export commodity is electrical machinery, while vehicles constitute the leading import.  The private sector constitutes the bulk of the economy, with government activity accounting for much less.  The economy is postindustrial, with the service sector contributing 67.8% of GDP.   The leading business field by gross business receipts is wholesale and retail trade; by net income it is finance and insurance.  The United States remains an industrial power, with chemical products the leading manufacturing field, The United States is also the third largest producer of oil in the world, as well as its largest importer.  It is the world&apos;s number one producer of electrical and nuclear energy, as well as liquid natural gas, sulfur, phosphates, and salt. While agriculture accounts for just under 1% of GDP, the United States is the world&apos;s top producer of corn and soybeans.  The New York Stock Exchange is the world&apos;s largest by dollar volume exchange market in the world, with the two most recoognized trade names in the world, the American company Coca Cola and McDonalds.</string>
		<key>science</key>
		<string>The United States has been a leader in scientific research and technological innovation since the late 19th century. In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone. Thomas Edison&apos;s laboratory developed the phonograph, the first long-lasting light bulb, and the first viable movie camera. Nikola Tesla pioneered alternating current, the AC motor, and radio. In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of Ransom E. Olds and Henry Ford promoted the assembly line. The Wright brothers, in 1903, made the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.  The rise of Nazism in the 1930s led many European scientists, including Albert Einstein and Enrico Fermi, to immigrate to the United States. During World War II, the Manhattan Project developed nuclear weapons, ushering in the Atomic Age. The Space Race produced rapid advances in rocketry, materials science, and computers. The United States largely developed the ARPANET and its successor, the Internet. Today, the bulk of research and development funding, 64%, comes from the private sector.  The United States leads the world in scientific research papers and impact factor.  Americans possess high levels of technological consumer goods and almost half of U.S. households have broadband Internet access.  The country is the primary developer and grower of genetically modified food; more than half of the world&apos;s land planted with biotech crops is in the United States.</string>
		<key>energy</key>
		<string>The United States is the world&apos;s third largest producer of oil and ironically its largest importer as well.  The U.S. is looking to limit its dependence on foreign energy, mostly oil.  The U.S. is also outspending nearly the rest of the world combined for renewable energy research, for such technologies as fuel-cells and certain nanotechnologies.  Despite the enormous wealth of natural resources, the U.S. in striving to move away from non-renewable resources such as oil and coal and are turning to wind, solar and electric.  These changes are especially being done in the state of California, which when compared to the rest of the world, has the 6th largest economy in the world.  They are seen as a pioneer state for &quot;going green&quot; and new energy resources.

		<string>Uzbekistan, officially the Republic of Uzbekistan is a landlocked country in Central Asia, formerly part of the Soviet Union. It shares borders with Kazakhstan to the west and to the north, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan to the east, and Afghanistan and Turkmenistan to the south. Once part of the Persian Samanid and later Timurid empires, the region was conquered in the early 16th century by Uzbek nomads, who spoke an Eastern Turkic language. Most of Uzbekistan’s population today belong to the Uzbek ethnic group and speak the Uzbek language, one of the family of Turkic languages. Uzbekistan was incorporated into the Russian Empire in the 19th century and in 1924 became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union, known as the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic (Uzbek SSR). It has been an independent republic since December 1991.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>The Uzbek language is the only official state language, however the Tajik language is widespread in the cities of Bukhara and Samarqand because of their relatively large population of ethnic Tajiks.  Russian is still an important language for interethnic communication, especially in the cities, including much day-to-day technical, scientific, governmental and business use. Russian is the main language of over 14% of the population and is spoken as a second language by many more.  In 1992 Uzbekistan officially shifted back to Latin script from traditional considerations of consistency with Turkey, but many signs and notices (including official government boards in the streets) are still written in Uzbek Cyrillic script that had been used in Uzbek SSR since 1940. Computers as a rule operate using the &quot;Uzbek Cyrillic&quot; keyboard, and Latin script is reportedly composed using the standard English keyboard.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Along with many Commonwealth of Independent States economies, Uzbekistan&apos;s economy declined during the first years of transition and then recovered after 1995, as the cumulative effect of policy reforms began to be felt. It has shown robust growth, rising by 4% per year between 1998 and 2003 and accelerating thereafter to 7%-8% per year. According to IMF estimates, the GDP in 2008 will be almost double its value in 1995.  Economic production is concentrated in commodities: Uzbekistan is now the world&apos;s sixth-largest producer and second-largest exporter of cotton, as well as the seventh largest world producer of gold. It is also a regionally significant producer of natural gas, coal, copper, oil, silver and uranium.  Agriculture employs 28% of Uzbekistan&apos;s labor force and contributes 24% of its GDP.</string>
		<key>transportation</key>
		<string>Tashkent, the nation&apos;s capital and largest city, has a three-line rapid transit system built in 1977, and expanded in 2001 after ten years&apos; independence from the Soviet Union. Uzbekistan is currently the only country in Central Asia with a subway system, which is promoted as one of the cleanest systems in the former Soviet Union. The stations are exceedingly ornate. For example, the station Metro Kosmonavtov built in 1984 is decorated using a space travel theme to recognise the achievements of mankind in space exploration and to commemorate the role of Vladimir Dzhanibekov, the Soviet cosmonaut of Uzbek origin. A statue of Vladimir Dzhanibekov stands near one of the station&apos;s entrances.</string>
		<key>environment</key>
		<string>Uzbekistan&apos;s environmental situation ought to be a major concern among the international community. Decades of questionable Soviet policies in pursuit of greater cotton production have resulted in a catastrophic scenario. The agricultural industry appears to be the main contributor to the pollution and devastation of the air and water in the country.  The Aral Sea disaster is a classic example. The Aral Sea used to be the fourth-largest inland sea on Earth, acting as an influencing factor in the air moisture.  Since the 1960s, the decade when the misuse of the Aral Sea water began, it has shrunk to less than 50% of its former area and decreased in volume threefold.  Due to the virtually insoluble Aral Sea problem, high salinity and contamination of the soil with heavy elements are especially widespread in Karakalpakstan – the region of Uzbekistan adjacent to the Aral Sea. The bulk of the nation&apos;s water resources is used for farming, which accounts for nearly 94% of the water usage and contributes to high soil salinity. Heavy use of pesticides and fertilizers for cotton growing further aggravates soil pollution.  These climate change related problems have pushed Uzbekistan to put tremendous funds into research for global warming and climate change, in order to properly preserve their wealth of natural resources and agricultural strength.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>Uzbekistan will continue to grow as one of the fastestt expanding economies and continue to be an example nation for the rest of the former Soviet block.  As a nation they will continue to be a leader in exports such as gold, cotton and other valuable resources, as well as taking initiative against global warming and climate change.</string>

		<string>Vatican City is a walled enclave within the city of Rome. With an area of approximately 44 hectares (110 acres), and a population of 842, it is the smallest internationally recognized independent state in the world by both area and population.
It is an ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical state ruled by the Bishop of Rome—the Pope. The highest state functionaries are all Catholic clergy of various national origins. Since the return of the Popes from Avignonin 1377, they have generally resided at the Apostolic Palace within what is now Vatican City, although at times residing instead in the Quirinal Palace in Rome or elsewhere.
Vatican City is distinct from the Holy See (Latin: Sancta Sedes),which dates back to early Christianity and is the main episcopal see of 1.2 billion Latin and Eastern Catholic adherents around the globe. The independent city-state, on the other hand, came into existence in 1929 by the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and Italy, which spoke of it as a new creation, not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States (756–1870), which had previously encompassed much of central Italy. According to the terms of the treaty, the Holy See has &quot;full ownership, exclusive dominion, and sovereign authority and jurisdiction&quot; over the city-state.
Within Vatican City are cultural sites such as St. Peter&apos;s Basilica, the Sistine Chapel and the Vatican Museums. They feature some of the world&apos;s most famous paintings and sculptures. The unique economy of Vatican City is supported financially by the sale of postage stamps and tourist mementos, fees for admission to museums, and the sale of publications.</string>

Venezuela possesses borders with Guyana to the east, Brazil to the south, and Colombia to the west. Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, St. Lucia, Barbados, Curaçao, Bonaire, Aruba, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and the Leeward Antilles lie just north, off the Venezuelan coast. </string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>The petroleum sector dominates Venezuela&apos;s mixed economy, accounting for roughly a third of GDP, around 80% of exports, and more than half of government revenues.They also have gold, diamonds, and iron ore but they do not have as great of an impact on the economy. Venezuela contains some of the largest oil and natural gas reserves in the world. It consistently ranks among the top ten crude oil producers in the world.  Venezuela has the least expensive petrol in the world because of its high government subsidies.</string>
		<key>resources</key>
		<string>Oil history was made in 1943 when Standard Oil of New Jersey accepted a new agreement in Venezuela, terms even more favorable to Venezuela were negotiated in 1945, after a coup brought to power a left-leaning government that included Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso. In 1958 a new government again included Pérez Alfonso, who devised a plan for the international oil cartel that would become OPEC.  In 1973 Venezuela voted to nationalize its oil industry outright, effective January 1, 1976, with Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) taking over and presiding over a number of holding companies; in subsequent years, Venezuela built a vast refining and marketing system in the U.S. and Europe, that would become the greatest in the world.</string>
		<key>energy</key>
		<string>The Government of Venezuela has opened up much of the hydrocarbon sector to foreign investment, promoting multi-billion dollar investment in heavy oil production, reactivation of old fields, and investment in several petrochemical joint ventures. Almost 60 foreign companies representing 14 different countries participate in one or more aspects of Venezuela&apos;s oil sector. The Venezuelan national oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) and foreign oil companies have signed 33 operating contracts for marginal fields in three bidding rounds. New legislation dealing with natural gas and petrochemicals is further opening the sector.</string>
		<key>agriculture</key>
		<string>The manufacturing sector continues to increase dramatically at a rate of 26.93% annually. Venezuela manufactures and exports steel, aluminum, transport equipment, textiles, apparel, beverages, and foodstuffs. It produces cement, tires, paper, fertilizer, and assembles cars both for domestic and export markets.

Agriculture accounts for approximately one-fourth of Venezuela&apos;s land area. Venezuela exports rice, corn, fish, tropical fruit, coffee, beef, and pork.  In 2002, U.S. firms exported $347 million worth of agricultural products, including wheat, corn, soybeans, soybean meal, cotton, animal fats, vegetable oils, and other items to make Venezuela one of the top two U.S. markets in South America. The United States supplies more than one-third of Venezuela&apos;s food imports.

Thanks to petroleum exports, Venezuela usually posts a trade surplus. In recent years, nonpetroleum exports have been growing rapidly but still constitute only about one-fourth of total exports. The United States is Venezuela&apos;s leading trade partner although Brazil is expected to surpass the U.S. by 2011. During 2002, the United States exported $4.4 billion in goods to Venezuela, making it the 25th-largest market for the U.S. Including petroleum products, Venezuela exported $15.1 billion in goods to the U.S., making it its 14th-largest source of goods.</string>

		<string>Venezuela looks likely to continue to grow based on its agricultural strengths and its extreme abundnace of natural resources, particularly oil.  It will continue to be a world leader in fuel production and exportation and they have also recently begun research into renewable energy resources, such as wind, solar power and hydroelectric as well.  Because of their economic strengths, natural resources and direct foreign investment, Venezuela will continue to grow and prosper in the future.</string>

		<string>Vietnam, officially the Socialist Republic of Vietnam is the easternmost country on the Indochina Peninsula in Southeast Asia. It is bordered by China to the north, Laos to the northwest, Cambodia to the southwest, and the South China Sea to the east. With a population of over 86 million, Vietnam is the 13th most populous country in the world.

The people of Vietnam regained independence and broke away from China in AD 938.  Successive dynasties flourished along with geographic and political expansion deeper into Southeast Asia, until it was colonized by the French in the mid-19th century. Efforts to resist the French eventually led to their expulsion from the country in the mid-20th century, leaving a nation divided politically into two countries. Fighting between the two sides continued during the Vietnam War, ending with a North Vietnamese victory in 1975.</string>
		<key>fauna</key>
		<string>According to the 2005 National Environmental Present Condition Report in terms of species diversity Vietnam is one of twenty five countries considered to possess a high level of biodiversity, and is ranked 16th in biological diversity (having 16% world&apos;s species).  Over 15,986 flora were identified within Vietnam, making it one of the largest in the world.  Statistics indicate that there are 307 nematodes, 200 oligochaeta, 145 acarina, 113 springtails, 7750 insects, 260 reptiles, 120 amphibians, 840 birds and 310 mammals of which 100 birds and 78 mammals are endemic.  In agricultural genetic diversity, Vietnam is one of the world&apos;s twelve original cultivar centers.  The Vietnam National Cultivar Gene Bank is preserving 12,300 cultivars of 115 species.  The Vietnamese government spent 49.07 million USD for preserving biodiversity in 2004 and has established 126 conservation areas including 28 national parks.  Vietnam has taken the steps to protect its natural wonders and to embark on research and studies to understand and combat climate change and global warming.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Historically, Vietnam has been an agricultural civilization based on wet rice cultivating.  The Government created a planned economy for the nation. Collectivization of farms, factories and economic capital was implemented, and millions of people were put to work in government programs. Vietnam achieved around 8% annual GDP growth from 1990 to 1997 and continued at around 7% from 2000 to 2005, making it the world&apos;s second-fastest growing economy. Simultaneously, foreign investment grew threefold and domestic savings quintupled. Manufacturing, information technology and high-tech industries form a large and fast-growing part of the national economy. Vietnam is a relative newcomer to the oil business, but today it is the third-largest oil producer in Southeast Asia with output of 400,000 barrels per day.  Vietnam is one of Asia&apos;s most open economies: two-way trade is around 160% of GDP, more than twice the ratio for China and over four times India&apos;s.</string>
		<key>infrastructure</key>
		<string>The modern transport network of Vietnam was originally developed under French rule for the purpose of raw materials harvesting, and reconstructed and extensively modernized following the Vietnam War. The road system is the most popular form of transportation in the country. Vietnam’s road system includes national roads administered by the central level, provincial roads managed by the provincial level, district roads managed by the district level, urban roads managed by cities and towns and commune roads managed by the commune level.

Bicycles, motor scooters and motorcycles remain the most popular forms of road transport in Vietnam&apos;s cities, towns, and villages although the number of privately-owned automobiles is also on the rise, especially in the larger cities. Public bus operated by private companies is the main long distance travel means for many people. Traffic congestion is a serious problem in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City as the cities&apos; roads struggle to cope with the booming numbers of automobiles. There are also more than 17,000 km of navigable waterways, which play a significant role in rural life owing to the extensive network of rivers in Vietnam.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>The people of Vietnam speak Vietnamese as a native language. In its early history, Vietnamese writing used Chinese characters. In the 13th century, the Vietnamese developed their own set of characters called Chu Nom.  Various other languages are spoken by several minority groups in Vietnam. The most common of these are Tày, MÆ°á»ng, Khmer, Chinese, Nùng, and H&apos;Mông. The French language, a legacy of colonial rule, is still spoken by some older Vietnamese as a second language, but is losing its popularity.  Russian — and to a much lesser extent German, Czech, or Polish — is sometimes known among those whose families had ties with the Soviet bloc. In recent years, English is becoming more popular as a second language. English study is obligatory in most schools. Chinese and Japanese have also become more popular.</string>
		<key>science</key>
		<string>Historically, Vietnamese scholars did not practice &quot;science&quot; in its generally accepted meaning, but many academic fields were well-developed, especially social sciences and humanities. It has at least ten centuries of commentary and analytic writings.  In mathematics, arithmetics and geometry has been taught in schools since the 15th century.</string>

		<string>Vanuatu, officially the Republic of Vanuatu, is an Oceanianisland nation located in the South Pacific Ocean. The archipelago, which is of volcanic origin, is some 1,750 kilometres (1,090 mi) east of northern Australia, 500 kilometres (310 mi) northeast of New Caledonia, east of New Guinea, southeast of the Solomon Islands, and west of Fiji.
Vanuatu was first inhabited by Melanesian people. The first Europeans to visit the islands were a Spanish expedition led by Portuguese navigator Fernandes de Queirós, who arrived on the largest island in 1606. He claimed the archipelago for Spain, as part of the colonial Spanish East Indies, and named it Austrialia del Espiritu Santo.
In the 1880s, France and the United Kingdom claimed parts of the archipelago, and in 1906 they agreed on a framework for jointly managing the archipelago as the New Hebrides through a British–French Condominium. An independence movement arose in the 1970s, and the Republic of Vanuatu was founded in 1980.</string>

		<string>Wallis and Futuna, officially the Territory of the Wallis and Futuna Islands, is aFrench island collectivity in the South Pacific between Tuvalu to the northwest, Rotuma of Fiji to the west, the main part of Fiji to the southwest, Tonga to the southeast, Samoa to the east, the New Zealand territory ofTokelau to the northeast and to a more distant north the Phoenix Islands (Kiribati). Wallis and Futuna is not part of French Polynesia, nor even contiguous with it, as the former are located at the very opposite western end ofPolynesia.
Its land area is 142.42 km2 (54.99 sq mi) with a population of about 12,000. Mata-Utu is the capital and biggest city. The territory is made up of three main volcanic tropical islands along with a number of tiny islets, and is split into two island groups that lie about 260 km (160 mi) apart, namely Wallis Islands (Uvea) in the northeast, and Hoorn Islands (also called the Futuna Islands) in the southwest, including Futuna Island proper and the mostly uninhabited Alofi Island.
Since 2003 Wallis and Futuna has been a French overseas collectivity (collectivité d&apos;outre-mer, or COM). Between 1961 and 2003, it had the status of a French overseas territory (territoire d&apos;outre-mer, or TOM), though its official name did not change when the status changed.</string>

		<string>Samoa, formerly known as Western Samoa, is an Oceanian country encompassing the western part of the Samoan Islands in the South Pacific Ocean. It became independent from New Zealand in 1962. The two main islands of Samoa are Upolu and Savai&apos;i, one of the biggest islands in Polynesia. The capital city, Apia, and Faleolo International Airport are situated on the island of Upolu.
Samoa was admitted to the United Nations on 15 December 1976. The entire island group, which includes American Samoa, was called &quot;Navigator Islands&quot; by European explorers before the 20th century because of the Samoans&apos; seafaring skills.
The language spoken is Samoan language or Gagana Fa&apos;asāmoa. This is the same language spoken in American Samoa.</string>

		<string>Yemen, officially the Republic of Yemen, is an Arab country located on the Arabian Peninsula in Southwest Asia. Yemen has an estimated population of more than 23 million people and is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the North, the Red Sea to the West, the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Aden to the South, and Oman to the east.  Yemen is the only republic on the Arabian Peninsula.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>While the national language is Arabic, Yemen is one of the main homelands of the South Semitic family of languages, which includes the non-Arabic language of the ancient Sabaean Kingdom. Its modern Yemeni descendants are closely related to the modern Semitic languages of Eritrea and Ethiopia. However, only a small remnant of those languages exists in modern Yemen, notably on the island of Socotra and in the back hills of the Hadhramaut coastal region. Modern South Arabian languages spoken in Yemen include Mehri, with 70,643 speakers, Soqotri, with an estimated 43,000 speakers in the Socotra archipelago and 67,000 worldwide, Bathari (with an estimated total of only 200 speakers), and Hobyót language.</string>
		<key>education</key>
		<string>Foreign language in public schools is taught from grade seven on, though the quality of public school instruction is low. Private schools using a British or American system teach English and produce proficient speakers, but Arabic is the dominant language of regular communication. The number of English speakers in Yemen is small compared to other Arab countries such as Egypt, Lebanon, the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Private schools have also started to teach French alongside Arabic and English.</string>
		<key>environment</key>
		<string>A number of Red Sea islands, including the Hanish Islands, Kamaran and Perim, as well as Socotra in the Arabian Sea belong to Yemen. Many of the islands are volcanic; for example Jabal al-Tair had a volcanic eruption in 2007 and before that in 1883.  Yemen is the world&apos;s 49th-largest country (after France). It is comparable in size to Thailand, and somewhat larger than the U.S. state of California.  Until recently, Yemen&apos;s northern border was undefined because the Arabian Desert prevented any human habitation there.  The country can be divided geographically into four main regions: the coastal plains in the west, the western highlands, the eastern highlands, and the Rub al Khali in the east.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>In the future Yemen will look to continue to grow based on its uniqe culture and diverse population.  As a nation, they are looking to move away from oil and other non-renewable forms of energy.  Currently they have an extremely vast amount of oil and are one of the world&apos;s largest producers and exporters, but estimates show that by 2020, they may be completely dry from any oil whatsoever.  This has propelled them to research other renewable energy forms such as wind and solar, to harvest the natural power of the sun that is present is so much of their desert climate.</string>

The neighbouring countries are the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north, Tanzania to the north-east, Malawi to the east, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana, and Namibia to the south, and Angola to the west.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>In Zambia, English is the official language, this is used in business and in schools, however there are also a large number of indigenous languages which are commonly spoken in Zambia, including, Ambo, Aushi, Bemba, Bisa, Chikunda, Cishinga, Cokwe, Gova, Ila, Inamwanga, Iwa, Kabende, Kaonde, Kosa, Kunda, Kwandi, Kwandu, Kwangwa, Lala, Lamba, Lenje, Leya, Lima, Liyuwa, Lozi, Luano, Lucazi, Lumbu, Lunda, Lundwe, Lungu, Luunda, Luvale, Makoma, Mambwe, Mashasha, Mashi, Mbowe, Mbukushu, Mbumi, Mbunda, Mbwela, Mukulu, Mulonga, Ndembu, Ng&apos;umbo, Nkoya, Nsenga, Nyanja, Nyengo, Nyiha, Sala, Seba, Senga, Shanjo, Shila, Simaa, Soli, Subiya, Swaka, Tabwa, Tambo, Toka, Tonga, Totela, Tumbuka, Twa, Unga, Wandya and Yombe. 
Since there has been intense urbanization in Zambia, many of these languages often get assimilated into each other and create slangs.  English is the most common language spoken at home and for official use as well.  Foreign peoples have also influenced the language culture as well, languages like Bemba, Kaonde, Lunda, Luvale, Nyanja and Tonga come from other country explorers as an example.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>In recent years foreign investment, especially by the U.K. and other European Nations, has allowed Zambia to revitalize its copper industry and bring it back to the product level that it was in the past.  This has had tremendous effects on the Zambian economy and has dramatically boosted the nation&apos;s GDP. The Zambian government is pursuing an economic diversification programme to reduce the economy&apos;s reliance on the copper industry. This initiative seeks to exploit other components of Zambia&apos;s rich resource base by promoting agriculture, tourism, gemstone mining, and hydro-power.  Zambia has also begun research to develop wind, solar and hydroenergy resources.</string>
		<key>culture</key>
		<string>Zambia has its own unique Bantu culture and mixed European culture. People used to live in secluded villages, but now since there has been intense urbanization, people are living all together and assimilating their cultures into one.  Different groups of ethnic peoples have begun living in very tight communes and this has blended their culture togther even more in recent years.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>Zambia looks to continue to grow based on its agricultural strengths, and it has been able to expand over recent years.  The government has enacted reforms and policies to further stimulate business and industry within the nation. This has been done with particular emphasis on such industries as agriculture, textiles, finance and tourism.  Zambia has also become an African leader in renewable energy research, particularly in wind, solar and hydroelectric.</string>

		<key>about</key>
		<string>Zimbabwe is a landlocked country located in the southern part of the continent of Africa, between the Zambezi and Limpopo rivers. It is bordered by South Africa to the south, Botswana to the southwest, Zambia to the northwest and Mozambique to the east.  It is a mineral and natural resource rich country and generates most of its GDP from these industries, as well as tourism. </string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>Zimbabwe has English as its official language, however the majority of the population speaks Shona, the native language of the Shona people, a Bantu language. Its other native language, Sindebele, is spoken by the Matabele people.  Unlike many other African countries, Zimbabwe has only a few dialects and languages spoken by the majority of its population, this allows for a higher literacy rate and increased communication within the country.</string>
		<key>resources</key>
		<string>For Zimbabwe, minerals, natural resources, mining, agriculture and tourism are the main industries within the nation.  The mining sector remains very lucrative, with some of the world&apos;s largest platinum reserves being mined by Anglo-American and Impala Platinum.  Zimbabwe is the biggest trading partner of South Africa on the continent.  Zimbabwe maintained positive economic growth throughout the 1980s and 90s, and looks to continue to do so.  As like many other African nations, they are rich in terms of natural resources and minerals and they look to expand upon these resources for the benefit of their exportation industry. </string>
		<key>education</key>
		<string>The nation of Zimbabwe has the 2nd highest literacy rate in all of Africa, at over 90% of its adult population.  This is an extremely high figure and adds to the cultural strength of the nation as a whole.  The richer families send their children to privately owned schools for their education, whereas the majority of children go to government funded public schools.  While private education can be rather expensive in Zimbabwe, public school is paid for by the government and therefore is free for all citizens.</string>
		<key>tourism</key>
		<string>Zimbabwe has a rich tourism industry, and has partnerships with many large airlines such as Australian Airlines, British Airways and German Lufthansa.  Zimbabwe is able to  boast several major tourist attractions, the most popular being Victoria Falls, which is estimated to be the largest waterfall in the world.  This large waterfall is also in part of Zambia, as the two countries work together in order to mutually benefit from the tourists they attract.  The Victoria Falls National Park is also in this area and is one of the eight main national parks in Zimbabwe, the largest of which is Hwange National Park.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>Zimbabwe looks to continue to grow based on its wealth of natural resources and minerals as well as its strong industrial sectors that include mining, agriculture and tourism.  Zimbabwe will try to expand its tourism industry in particular, in order to show the world all of the wonders that Zimbabwe has to offer.  It is expected that the economy of Zimbabwe will continue to grow in the near future and will become an African leader in the exportation industry.  Furthermore, with one of the highest literacy rates in Africa, Zimbabwe will continue their research into renewable energy sources such as wind, solar and hydroenergy.</string>

		<string>Tuvalu is a Polynesian island nation located in the Pacific Ocean, midway between Hawaii and Australia. It comprises three reefislands and six true atolls spread out between the latitude of 5° to 10° south and longitude of 176° to 180°, west of the International Date Line. Its nearest neighbours are Kiribati, Nauru, Samoa and Fiji. Tuvalu has a population of 10,837. The total land area of the islands of Tuvalu is 26 square kilometres (10 sq mi).
The first inhabitants of Tuvalu were Polynesians. The pattern of settlement that is believed to have occurred is that the Polynesians spread out from Samoa and Tonga into the Tuvaluan atolls, with Tuvalu providing a stepping stone to migration into the Polynesian Outlier communities in Melanesia and Micronesia.
In 1568 Spanish navigator Álvaro de Mendaña was the first European to sail through the archipelago, sighting the island of Nui during his expedition in search of Terra Australis. In 1819 the island of Funafuti was named Ellice&apos;s Island; the name Ellice was applied to all nine islands after the work of English hydrographer Alexander George Findlay (1812–1876). The islands came under Britain&apos;s sphere of influence in the late 19th century, when each of the Ellice Islands was declared a British Protectorate by Captain Gibson R.N., of HMS Curacoa, between 9 and 16 October 1892. The Ellice Islands were administered as British protectorate by a Resident Commissioner from 1892 to 1916 as part of the British Western Pacific Territories (BWPT), and later as part of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony from 1916 to 1974.</string>

		<string>Tajikistan, officially the Republic of Tajikistan is a mountainous landlocked country in Central Asia. Afghanistan borders to the south, Uzbekistan to the west, Kyrgyzstan to the north, and People&apos;s Republic of China to the east. Tajikistan also lies adjacent to Pakistan but is separated by the narrow Wakhan Corridor. Most of Tajikistan&apos;s population belongs to the Tajik ethnic group, who share culture and history with the Iranian peoples and speak the Persian language (officially referred to as Tajiki in Tajikistan). Once part of the Samanid Empire, Tajikistan became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union in the 20th century, known as the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic (Tajik SSR).  Since the end of the war, newly-established political stability and foreign aid have allowed the country&apos;s economy to grow. Trade in commodities such as cotton and aluminum wire has contributed greatly to this steady improvement, but lack of natural resources has hampered its economic recovery.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>With foreign revenue precariously dependent upon exports of cotton and aluminium, the economy is highly vulnerable to external shocks.  Tajikistan&apos;s economy grew substantially after the war. The GDP of Tajikistan expanded at an average rate of 9.6 % over the period of 2000–2004 according to the World Bank data, this has improved Tajikistan&apos;s position among other Central Asian countries.  Tajikistan is an active member of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO).  The recently completed Anzab tunnel which connects the previously hard to access Northern part of the country to the capital Dushanbe has been labeled as part of the new Silk Road. It is part of a road under construction that will connect Tajikistan to Iran and the Persian Gulf through Afghanistan.</string>
		<key>environment</key>
		<string>Tajikistan is landlocked, and is the smallest nation in Central Asia by area. It is covered by mountains of the Pamir range, and more than fifty percent of the country is over 3,000 meters (approx. 10,000 ft) above sea level. The only major areas of lower land are in the north (part of the Fergana Valley), and in the southern Kofarnihon and Vakhsh river valleys, which form the Amu Darya. Dushanbe is located on the southern slopes above the Kofarnihon valley.The Amu Darya and Panj rivers mark the border with Afghanistan, and the glaciers in Tajikistan&apos;s mountains are the major source of runoff for the Aral Sea. There are over 900 rivers in Tajikistan longer than 10 kilometers.  Because of the abudnace of rivers in Tajikistan, they produce an enormous amount of hydro-power, this is their main export aside from cotton.  With the global warming and climate changes that are taking effect, Tajikistan will be an important source of energy for the future as they are a leader in hydro-energy.</string>
		<key>culture</key>
		<string>Historically, Tajiks and Persians come from very similar stock, speaking variants of the same language and are related as part of the larger group of Iranian peoples. The Tajik language is the mother tongue of around two-thirds of the citizens of Tajikistan. Ancient towns such as Bukhara, Samarkand, Herat, Balkh and Khiva are no longer part of the country. The main urban centers in today&apos;s Tajikistan include Dushanbe, Khujand, Kulob, Panjakent and Istaravshan.  The Pamiri people of Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province in the southeast, bordering Afghanistan and China, though considered part of the Tajik ethnicity, nevertheless are distinct linguistically and culturally from most Tajiks. In contrast to the mostly Sunni Muslim residents of the rest of Tajikistan, the Pamiris overwhelmingly follow the Ismaili sect of Islam, and speak a number of Eastern Iranian languages, including Shughni, Rushani, Khufi and Wakhi. Isolated in the highest parts of the Pamir Mountains, they have preserved many ancient cultural traditions and folk arts that have been largely lost elsewhere in the country.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>Tajikistan has much room to improve its growing economy and will look to do so in the near future.  They will continue to be a global leader in cotton production as well as aluminum exports.  Also because of their abundant wealth of natural rivers, Tajikistan will continue to be a global leader in hydro-energy production, which will be particularly important in the years to come.</string>

		<string>The Kingdom of Thailand is an independent country that lies in the heart of Southeast Asia. It is bordered to the north by Laos and Myanmar, to the east by Laos and Cambodia, to the south by the Gulf of Thailand and Malaysia, and to the west by the Andaman Sea and Myanmar. By the maritime boundary, the country is bordered to the southeast by Vietnam in the Gulf of Thailand, to the southwest by Indonesia and India in the Andaman Sea.  The capital and largest city of Thailand is Bangkok. It is also the country&apos;s center of political, commercial, industrial and cultural activities.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>The official language of Thailand is the Thai language, a Kradai language closely related to Lao, Shan in Burma, and numerous smaller languages spoken in an arc from Hainan and Yunan south to the Malaysian border. It is the principal language of education and government and spoken throughout the country. The standard is based on the dialect of the Central Thai people, and it is written in the Thai alphabet, an abugida script that evolved from the Khmer script. Several other dialects exist, and coincide with the regional designations. Southern Thai is spoken in the southern provinces, and Northern Thai is spoken in the provinces that were formally part of the independent kingdom of Lannathai.  Thailand is also host to several other minority languages, the largest of which is the Lao dialect of Isan spoken in the northeastern provinces. Although sometimes considered a Thai dialect, it is a Lao dialect, and the region in where it is traditionally spoken was historically part of the Lao kingdom of Lan Xang. In the far south, Yawi, a dialect of Malay, is the primary language of the Malay Muslims.

Chinese dialects are also spoken by the large Chinese population, Teochew being the dialect best represented.
Numerous tribal languages are also spoken, including those belonging to the Mon-Khmer family, such as Mon, Khmer, Viet, Mlabri; Austronesian family, such as Cham, Moken, and Orang Asli, Sino-Tibetan family such as Hmong, Lawa, Akhan, and Karen; and other Tai languages such as Nyaw, Phu Thai, and Saek.  English is a mandatory school subject, but the number of fluent speakers remains very low, especially outside the cities.</string>
		<key>culture</key>
		<string>The culture of Thailand incorporates a great deal of influence from India, China, Cambodia, and the rest of Southeast Asia. Thailand&apos;s main theology Theravada Buddhism is central to modern Thai identity and belief. In practice, Thai Buddhism has evolved over time to include many regional beliefs originating from Hinduism, animism as well as ancestor worship. In areas in the southernmost parts of Thailand, Islam is prevalent. Several different ethnic groups, many of which are marginalized, populate Thailand. Some of these groups overlap into Burma, Laos, Cambodia, and Malaysia and have maintained a distinctly traditional way of life despite strong Thai cultural influence. Overseas Chinese also form a significant part of Thai society, particularly in and around Bangkok. Their successful integration into Thai society has allowed for this group to hold positions of economic and political power.  Like most Asian cultures, respect towards ancestors is an essential part of Thai spiritual practice. Thais have a strong sense of hospitality and generosity, but also a strong sense of social hierarchy. Seniority is an important concept in Thai culture. Elders have by tradition ruled in family decisions or ceremonies.</string>
		<key>education</key>
		<string>Thailand enjoys a high level of literacy, and education is provided by a well organized school system of kindergartens, primary, lower secondary and upper secondary schools, numerous vocational colleges, and universities. The private sector of education is well developed and significantly contributes to the overall provision of education which the government would not be able to meet through the public establishments. Education is compulsory up to and including Grade 9, and the government provides free education through to Grade 12.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Thailand is an emerging economy and considered as a Newly Industrialized Country. After enjoying the world&apos;s highest growth rate from 1985 to 1996 averaging 9.4% annually, which is considered to be tremendous growth.  Thailand exports an increasing value of over $105 billion worth of goods and services annually.  Major exports include Thai rice, textiles and footwear, fishery products, rubber, jewelry, automobiles, computers and electrical appliances. Thailand is the world’s no.1 exporter of rice, exporting more than 6.5 million tons of milled rice annually. Rice is the most important crop in the country. Thailand has the highest percent of arable land, 27.25%, of any nation in the Greater Mekong Subregion, with about 55% of the available land area used for rice production.  Substantial industries include electric appliances, components, computer parts and automobiles, while tourism makes up about 6% of the Thai economy.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>Thailand has never been colonized, and its educational system is not based on European models to any great extent.  Because of their unique situation, the country will continue to grow and prosper.  They will continue to be a highly educated country, as well as the worlds leading exporter of rice.</string>

		<string>Turkey, known officially as the Republic of Turkey is a Eurasian country that stretches across the Anatolian peninsula in western Asia and Thrace in the Balkan region of southeastern Europe. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Bulgaria to the northwest; Greece to the west; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, Azerbaijan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the southeast. The Mediterranean Sea and Cyprus are to the south; the Aegean Sea and Archipelago are to the west; and the Black Sea is to the north. Separating Anatolia and Thrace are the Sea of Marmara and the Turkish Straits (the Bosporus and the Dardanelles), which are commonly reckoned to delineate the border between Asia and Europe, thereby making Turkey transcontinental. 

Due to its strategic location astride two continents, Turkey&apos;s culture has a unique blend of Eastern and Western tradition. A powerful regional presence in the Eurasian landmass with strong historic, cultural and economic influence in the area between Europe in the west and Central Asia in the east, Russia in the north and the Middle East in the south, Turkey has come to acquire increasing strategic significance.</string>
		<key>culture</key>
		<string>Turkey has a very diverse culture that is a blend of various elements of the OÄŸuz Turkic, Anatolian, Ottoman, which was itself a continuation of both Greco-Roman and Islamic cultures and Western culture and traditions, which started with the Westernization of the Ottoman Empire and still continues today. This mix originally began as a result of the encounter of Turks and their culture with those of the peoples who were in their path during their migration from Central Asia to the West.  As Turkey successfully transformed from the religion-based former Ottoman Empire into a modern nation-state with a very strong separation of state and religion, an increase in the methods of artistic expression followed. During the first years of the republic, the government invested a large amount of resources into fine arts; such as museums, theatres, opera houses and architecture. Because of different historical factors playing an important role in defining the modern Turkish identity, Turkish culture is a product of efforts to be &quot;modern&quot; and Western, combined with the necessity felt to maintain traditional religious and historical values.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Turkey is a founding member of the OECD and the G-20 major economies.  During the first six decades of the Republic, between 1923 and 1983, Turkey has mostly adhered to a quasi-statist approach with strict government planning of the budget and government-imposed limitations over private sector participation, foreign trade, flow of foreign currency, and foreign direct investment. However, starting from 1983, Turkey began a series of reforms that were initiated by Prime Minister Turgut Özal and designed to shift the economy from a statist, insulated system to a more private-sector, market-based model.  The reforms spurred rapid growth that would continue into the late 2000&apos;s, this success is partly why Turkey is a member of the G-20 major economies and considered to be a major player in the global economy.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>Turkey looks set to continue to grow, based on its expanding economy and dominant power in the global business world.  As a founding member of OECD, Turkey will also continue to lead the way in climate change and global warming research and solutions as well.  Because of Turkey&apos;s strategic location between Europe and Asia, it will also continue to be an important liason between these two continents, providing an example of how they can assimilate their cultures and have a mutual and beneficial relationship between each other.</string>
		<key>climate</key>
		<string>Turkey is a transcontinental Eurasian country. Asian Turkey is made up largely of Anatolia which includes 97% of the country, is separated from European Turkey by the Bosporus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form a water link between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.  European Turkey is extremely small and only includes 3% of the country.  Turkey has a vast wealth of natural resources and an infrastructure that like many other countries is threatened by global warming and climate change.  Turkey has taken the initiative as an OECD member and joined many other Eurasian countries in devoting studies and research towards understanding and controlling climate change and global warming.</string>

		<string>Turkmenistan is a Turkic country in Central Asia. Until 1991, it was a constituent republic of the Soviet Union, the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic (Turkmen SSR). It is bordered by Afghanistan to the southeast, Iran to the southwest, Uzbekistan to the northeast, Kazakhstan to the northwest, and the Caspian Sea to the west. The name Turkmenistan derives from Persian, meaning &quot;land of the Turkmen&quot;. The name of its capital, Ashgabat, means &quot;the City of Arsaces&quot; in Persian. It also loosely translates as &quot;the city of love&quot; or &quot;the city that love built&quot;.  Although it is wealthy in natural resources in certain areas, most of the country is covered by the Karakum (Black Sands) Desert.</string>
		<key>language</key>
		<string>Turkmen is the official language of Turkmenistan per the 1992 Constitution, although Russian still is widely spoken in cities as a &quot;language of inter-ethnic communication&quot;. Turkmen is spoken by 72% of the population, Russian 12%, Uzbek 9%, and other languages 7%.  The CIA World Factbook gives the ethnic composition of Turkmenistan as 85% Turkmen, 5% Uzbek, 4% Russian and 6% other.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>Half of the country&apos;s irrigated land is planted with cotton, making the country the world&apos;s tenth-largest producer of it. It possesses the world&apos;s fifth-largest reserves of natural gas and substantial oil resources. In 1994, the Russian government&apos;s refusal to export Turkmen gas to hard currency markets and mounting debts of its major customers in the former Soviet Union for gas deliveries contributed to a sharp fall in industrial production and caused the budget to shift from a surplus to a slight deficit.</string>
		<key>outlook</key>
		<string>Turkmenistan will look to continue to grow based on its diverse population and unique cultural backgrounds.  There is much room for improvement in their economy as well as in their infrastructure.  They will also continue to be a global leader in cotton exportation as well.  Also they will remain a world provider of oil and gas as well.  Knowing that their fuel reserves are not unlimited, Turkmenistan has begun research into renewable forms of energy in order to assmilate into the future market that is rapidly approaching.</string>

		<string>In 1st century BC, Romans invaded the UK and brought Britain into contact with Europe. They withdrew in 5th century AD, leaving behind many reminders of their occupation which form a fascinating part of the archaeology of Britain today. The departure of the Romans left Britain vulnerable to invasion by many races, including Angles, Saxons and Jutes, which marked the beginning of Anglo Saxon Britain and caused original Britons to flee to Wales and Scotland. The country finally became united under the Kings of Wessex, and after the death of Edward the Confessor in 1066, there was a dispute over succession and William the Conqueror invaded.

In 1215, King John signed the Magna Carta, which awarded basic rights to the people of Britain. The House of Commons was developed in the 13th and 14th centuries, and this was followed by the Hundred Years War against France and the Black Death. By 1485, the Tudors had won the throne of England in the Battle of Bosworth, marking the end of the Wars of the Roses.

The independence of the Church of England from Roman Catholicism was established under the reign of Henry VIII, and after much tension between the two, Queen Elizabeth I propounded a milder, modernised Church of England.

Throughout the latter half of the 17th century the struggle between Parliament and monarchy established the primacy of Parliament. When Queen Anne died in 1714, the Hanoverian line began, the first sovereign of which was King George I. His relutance to manage the political affairs of the country lead to the establishment of the cabinet and the appointment of a First Lord of the Treasury. In the time of Robert Walpole, this position came to be known as Prime Minister.

The Treaty of Union, 22nd July 1706, was agreed by the Kingdom of England (including Wales) and the Kingdom of Scotland. A year later, on 1st May 1707, the United Kingdom was created. Ireland, which had been under the control of England since 1691, did not merge with the United Kingdom until 1800.

Britain had begun establishing its empire in the 16th and 17th centuries through trading outposts and colonies in the Americas and Africa. This rose to become an enormous global power by the 1920s, when the British Empire covered approximately a quarter of the globe.

In the early 20th century, following Queen Victoria&apos;s reign, Britain entered both the First and Second World Wars, suffering heavy losses, particularly in WWI.

Queen Elizabeth II entered her reign in 1952, and in 1992 the UK became one of the 12 founding members of the European Union.</string>
		<key>economy</key>
		<string>The United Kingdom has one of the highest GDPs in the world, and as such remains a global power. It is a founding member of the EU, and is also member of such organisations as the United Nations Security Council, G8, NATO, OECD, WTO and the Commonwealth of Nations. Much of the UK&apos;s labour force work in the service sector, and within that the finance and tourism sectors are most important; other key industries include electric equipment, chemicals, metals, petroleum, shipbuilding and clothing. The UK has some coal reserves and dwindling natural gas and oil resources, although UCG is another energy alternative.</string>
		<key>culture</key>
		<string>Food
Nowadays the UK is highly multicultural and many different foods from around the world can be found throughout the country; Chinese, Indian, Italian, French, Japanese and many more. True English cuisine has been thought to include the English breakfast,  roast dinners, fish and chips, bangers and mash, sandwiches, and pies, but other more sophisticated and typically English cuisine includes high tea, cheeses (such as Cheddar and Wensleydale), and pickles and preserves. Of course, the British are also known for their sterling ability to drink copious amounts of tea. 
Literature
England is able to lay claim to many famous and influential playwrights, poets and authors. Probably the most famous of all of these is William Shakespeare, the 16th century playwright who lived in Statford-upon-Avon. Other notable writers are Geoffrey Chaucer (Canterbury Tales) and Thomas Mallory (Le Morte d&apos;Arthur), Jane Austen, the Bronte sisters, Charles Dickens, Thomas Hardy, William Blake, William Wordsworth, H.G. Wells, Virginia Woolf, George Orwell, and even most recently, J.K. Rowling.

		<string>The Western Sahara is a disputed territory in the Maghrebregion of North Africa, bordered by Morocco to the north, Algeria to the extreme northeast, Mauritania to the east and south, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. Its surface area amounts to 266,000 square kilometres (103,000 sq mi). It is one of the most sparsely populated territories in the world, mainly consisting of desert flatlands. The population is estimated at just over 500,000, of whom nearly 40% live in El Aaiún (also spelled Laâyoune), the largest city in Western Sahara.
Occupied by Spain in the late 19th century, the Western Sahara has been on the United Nations list of non-self-governing territories since 1963 after a Moroccan demand. It is the most populous territory on that list, and by far the largest in area. In 1965, the UN General Assembly adopted its first resolution on Western Sahara, asking Spain to decolonise the territory. One year later, a new resolution was passed by the General Assembly requesting that a referendum be held by Spain on self-determination.
In 1975, Spain relinquished the administrative control of the territory to a joint administration by Morocco (which had formally claimed the territory since 1957) and Mauritania. A war erupted between those countries and the Sahrawi national liberation movement, the Polisario Front, which proclaimed the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) with a government-in-exile in Tindouf, Algeria. Mauritania withdrew in 1979, and Morocco eventually secured effective control of most of the territory, including all the major cities and natural resources.</string>

		<string>The Turks and Caicos Islands are a British Overseas Territory consisting of the larger Caicos Islands and smaller Turks Islands, two groups of tropical islands in the Lucayan Archipelago, part of the larger Antilles island grouping. They are known primarily for tourism and as an offshore financial centre. The resident population is about 31,500, of whom 23,769 live on Providenciales in the Caicos Islands. The total population on the islands including foreigners is 49,000.
The Turks and Caicos Islands lie southeast of Mayaguana in the Bahamas island chain and north of the island of Hispaniola. Cockburn Town, the capital since 1766, is situated on Grand Turk Island about 1,042 kilometres (647 mi) east-southeast of Miami, United States. The islands have a total land area of 430 square kilometres (170 sq mi).[b]
The first recorded European sighting of the islands now known as the Turks and Caicos occurred in 1512. In the subsequent centuries, the islands were claimed by several European powers with the British Empireeventually gaining control. For many years the islands were governed indirectly through Bermuda, the Bahamas, and Jamaica. When the Bahamas gained independence in 1973, the islands received their own governor and have remained a separate autonomous British Overseas Territory since. In August 2009, the United Kingdom suspended the Turks and Caicos Islands&apos; self-government after allegations of ministerial corruption. Home rule was restored in the islands after the November 2012 elections.</string>

		<string>Trinidad and Tobago is a twin island country off the northern edge of South America, lying just off the coast of northeastern Venezuela and south of Grenada in the Lesser Antilles.
Usually considered part of the Caribbean, it shares maritime boundaries with other nations including Barbados to the northeast, Grenada to the northwest, Guyana to the southeast, and Venezuela to the south and west.The country covers an area of 5,128 square kilometres (1,980 sq mi) and consists of two main islands, Trinidad and Tobago, with numerous smaller landforms. The two main islands are divided into nine regions, and oneward. Sangre Grande is the largest of the country&apos;s nine regions, comprising about 18% of the total area and 10% of the total population of the country. The nation lies outside of the hurricane belt.
The island of Trinidad was a Spanish colony from the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1498 to the capitulation of the Spanish Governor, Don José Maria Chacón, on the arrival of a British fleet of 18 warships on 18 February 1797. During the same period, the island of Tobago changed hands among Spanish, British, French, Dutch and Courlander colonizers. Trinidad and Tobago (remaining separate until 1889) were ceded to Britain in 1802 under the Treaty of Amiens. The country Trinidad and Tobago obtained independence in 1962, becoming a republic in 1976.</string>

		<string>Tonga is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 177 islands with a total surface area of about 750 square kilometres (290 sq mi) scattered over 700,000 square kilometres (270,000 sq mi) of the southern Pacific Ocean, of which 52 islands are inhabited by its 103,000 people. Seventy percent of Tongans reside on the main island of Tongatapu.
Tonga stretches over about 800 kilometres (500 mi) in a north-south line – about a third of the distance from New Zealand to Hawaii. It is surrounded by Fiji and Wallis and Futuna (France) to the northwest, Samoa to the northeast, Niue to the east, Kermadec (part of New Zealand) to the southwest, and New Caledonia (France) and Vanuatu to the farther west.
Tonga became known as the Friendly Islands because of the congenial reception accorded to Captain James Cook on his first visit in 1773. He arrived at the time of the ʻinasi festival, the yearly donation of the First Fruits to the Tuʻi Tonga (the islands&apos; paramount chief) and so received an invitation to the festivities. According to the writer William Mariner, the chiefs wanted to kill Cook during the gathering but could not agree on a plan.
Tonga has never lost its sovereignty to a foreign power. In 2010, Tonga took a decisive step towards becoming a fully functioning constitutional monarchy, after legislative reforms paved the way for its first partialrepresentative elections.</string>

		<string>Svalbard and Jan Mayen is a statistical designation defined by ISO 3166-1 of two parts of Norway under separate jurisdictions—Svalbard and Jan Mayen. While the two are combined for the purposes of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) category, they are not administratively related. This has further resulted in the country code top-level domain .sj being issued for Svalbard and Jan Mayen, and ISO 3166-2:SJ. The United Nations Statistics Division also uses this code, but has named it Svalbard and Jan Mayen Islands.
Svalbard is an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean under the full sovereignty of Norway, but is subject to the special status granted by the Svalbard Treaty. Jan Mayen is a remote island in the Arctic Ocean; it has no permanent population and is administrated by the County Governor of Nordland. Svalbard and Jan Mayen have in common that they are the only integrated parts of Norway not allocated to counties. While a separate ISO code for Svalbard was proposed by the United Nations, it was the Norwegian authorities who took initiative to include Jan Mayen in the code.</string>

		<string>South Sudan, officially the Republic of South Sudan,is a landlocked country in northeastern Africa that gained its independence from Sudan in 2011.Its current capital is Juba, which is also its largest city. It is planned that the capital city will be changed to the more centrally located Ramciel in the future.[12] South Sudan is bordered by the Republic of the Sudan to the north, Ethiopia to the east, Kenya to the southeast, Uganda to the south, the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the southwest, and the Central African Republic to the west. It includes the vast swamp region of the Sudd, formed by the White Nile and known locally as the Bahr al Jabal.
The territories of modern South Sudan and the Republic of the Sudan were occupied by Egypt under the Muhammad Ali Dynasty, and later governed as an Anglo-Egyptian condominium until Sudanese independence was achieved in 1956. Following the First Sudanese Civil War, the Southern Sudan Autonomous Region was formed in 1972 and lasted until 1983. A second Sudanese civil war soon developed and ended with theComprehensive Peace Agreement of 2005. Later that year, southern autonomy was restored when an Autonomous Government of Southern Sudan was formed.
South Sudan became an independent state on 9 July 2011, following a referendum that passed with 98.83% of the vote. It is a United Nations member state, a member state of the African Union, and a member state of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development. In July 2012, South Sudan signed the Geneva Conventions. South Sudan has suffered internal conflict since its independence.</string>
